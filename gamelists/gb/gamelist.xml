    <desc>This puzzle-game is the successor to Kwirk. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable. Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors.

The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</desc>

    <desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

The first level, Frostbite Falls, has the player controlling Bullwinkle, the second, on the Moon, uses Rocky, and the final one, the Abominable Manor, uses Bullwinkle again. Before the final section, a bonus level that has Bullwinkle running to the end of a football field to catch Rocky, while avoiding and head-butting football players on the way, can grant the player an extra life upon completion. The final section has a time limit to defeat the Fearless Leader and rescue your friend, dying in this three times will send the player back to the first section of the level. Despite the absence thereof, the game label still shows the "Friends" (e.g. Dudley Do-Right).</desc>

While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.

To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.

Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make Mr Pekles (a giant flower) give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.</desc>

However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.

The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.</desc>

There are a certain amount of lines with switches and dots that need activating.[3] Once all the lines are cleared, so are any enemies that are remaining in that level. A strict time limit make players lose their lives in addition to bumping into an enemy.

There is no regularity to the movement of the character, giving an element of luck to the game. Some aspects of background graphics appear in certain levels (especially on levels 12, 20, 28, and 36).  Level 40 is essentially a giant maze which leads up to a castle that ends the game.</desc>

    <name>Arcade Classics - Battlezone &amp; Super Breakout (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>Gameplay


Battlezone:


 A standard enemy tank in the player's sights in the military training version The Bradley Trainer.
Gameplay is on a plain with a mountainous horizon featuring a memorable erupting volcano, distant crescent moon, and various geometric solids (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The player views the screen, which includes an overhead radar view to find and destroy the rather slow tanks, or the faster moving supertanks. Saucer-shaped UFOs and guided missiles occasionally appear for a bonus opportunity. The saucers differ from the tanks in that they do not fire upon the player, and do not appear on radar. The player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on to buy time with which to fire himself. Common play in the US could run from 25 cents to a dollar per game, depending on machine setting. The typical setting is for 25 cent play, with three tanks.

A standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points, a supertank 3,000 points, and the flying saucer 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. An extra life is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points, and a further tank is then awarded at 100,000 points. No additional tanks are awarded until the score counter rolls over at ten million, and additional bonus tanks are again awarded at indicated scores of 15,000 and 100,000. The game only includes one hostile enemy on the game board at all times; the player never has to battle two enemy tanks at once, or a tank and guided missile. The UFO can appear on the screen at the same time as an enemy tank, and it can occasionally be destroyed by enemy fire.

The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible, and can block the movement of a player's tank. However, they are also useful as shields as they also block enemy fire as well.

There was a bug in some machines which caused very high phony scores into the seven digits to be posted (after a player would enter his initials). Good players could actually reach this level after an hour or two of play.


SUPER BREAKOUT:


In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:
Double gives the player control of two bats at the same timeone placed above the otherand two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.
Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.
Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

    <name>Asteroids (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.</desc>

    <name>Atomic Punk (USA)</name>
    <desc>There are four modes of gameplay in Atomic Punk, including two single player modes and two multiplayer game modes.

Solo:

"Game A" (known as "Bomber Boy" in the Japanese version) is similar to other games in the series, with a few differences. Power-ups, known as panels, which are usually gained in each level and carried over from one to the next, can also be bought from a store by using GP, which is collected depending on how much time it takes to complete a level and how many blocks are destroyed. At the beginning of each round, the player decides which panels to use to complete the round. Another difference is that the linear gameplay of the original, with the player advancing levels after completing each one, was changed to implement a world map with nine locations.

The second game mode, "Game B" (known as "Bomber Man" in the Japanese version) is the same as that in the original Bomberman game, but the stage area is squared rather than rectangular and the screen is always centered on Bomberman rather than scrolling when he touches the border.

Vs.:

Panel Mode, in which players begin with only one bomb to place at a time and a bomb blast length of one unit, and Bomb Up and Fire Up panels appear.

Powerful Mode, in which players have four bombs to place at a time and a bomb blast length of four units, and no panels appear.</desc>

    <desc>The game's protagonist is Chad Finletter, a young boy is on a quest to stop the evil scientist Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. During his journey he must fight through legions of mutant tomatoes, although this is a feat he will take on alone as the citizens of San Zucchini are too afraid of the mutant tomatoes to aid him.
 Much like other platform games of its time, the main method of killing the enemies is to jump on them, in this case squashing them, or breaking them into smaller tomato enemies. There are several bosses to take on including Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho.</desc>

    <name>Avenging Spirit (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>In Avenging Spirit the protagonist is a spirit out for revenge. He has been murdered by a group of gangsters and his girlfriend has taken hostage by them. Her father uses his brand new machine to call the man's spirit back from the dead, telling him that they are holding his daughter ransom unless he turns over his research of ghost energy.

In side-scrolling fashion, the game features six different stages - the city, the rooftops, a factory, the city sewers and two levels dealing with the mobsters base of operation. The player is able to possess enemies, 20 in all, and use any skills or weapons they have, to complete the level. The player's health is represented by ghost energy and it is drained when he is not inside a host. The story leads to two different endings.</desc>

Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).

    <name>B.C. Kid 2 (Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonkin a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

    <name>Balloon Kid (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>In 1-player mode, the gameplay is an arrangement of the Balloon Trip mode of Balloon Fight, where the screen automatically scrolls toward the left, while the player controls Alice that uses two balloons to float into the air with. To make her float in the air, the player must press (and sometimes hold) the A button to make her wave her arms to hover upward. Alice also has the ability to remove her balloons and walk on the ground, as well as jumping. If both of her balloons are popped or removed, and if she lands safely, she can inflate two new balloons and fly again.

The object of this mode is to travel from the beginning to the end while collecting balloons left by Alice's brother, Jim, along the way. The player must also prevent Alice from bumping into enemies that are attempting to pop her balloons, push her or kill her altogether. Some enemies, such as Balloon Birds, came from Balloon Fight. The giant fish that eats anyone who flies too close to the water, also came from Balloon Fight. There are four bosses in Balloon Kid. To defeat them, the player must make Alice fly about them and make her detach her balloons to bounce on them. She also can jump and stomp on them, whenever it is safe for her, like in other typical platformers.

The 2-player mode is loosely based on Balloon Fight's Game A and Game B modes, where one player battles against another player. One player controls Alice, while the other controls Alice's friend and eternal rival: Samm. The goal is to collect more balloons than the other player before they arrive at the end of the stage.

Balloon Kid's "Balloon Trip" mode is based on Balloon Fight's mode of the same name, but with Alice instead of a generic Balloon Fighter. Everything else, including the BGM itself, are unchanged from Balloon Fight's Balloon Trip mode.</desc>

The environment features a shopping mall level, an underwater level, and other worlds to explore. The game is also centered around collecting gems and pearls to fend off opponents.

Enemies in the game include the usual sharks found in underwater levels in addition to jellyfish. Moving cubes of sugar must also be defeated in the game. The bonus rounds of the game are essentially a Concentration-type game where matching identical cards lead to extra points for the player.</desc>

    <desc>Batman: Return of the Joker for the Game Boy is a platformer in which the Dark Knight must cross four levels to confront his arch-enemy, the Joker.

The first three of the stages (Sewers, Machine Shop and Train) can be tackled in any order, but the final level only opens up once the others are completed. In each, Batman has to face obstacles like traps, conveyor belts, moving platforms and many henchmen. He can use his fists to punch enemies as well as batarangs (with limited ammunition) to knock them out from afar. Batman's grappling hook connects to ceilings and is used to pull him across chasms or up platforms. He can also utilize a wall jump to get higher in narrow spaces. Power-ups to collect are health upgrades and batarang ammunition. At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits. Some of the bosses are immune to the batarangs, but all have a certain weakness.</desc>

    <desc>The player controls a driver of an excavation vehicle as he competes in a 48-level tournament of drilling things.

Players have to kill rival drivers only by pushing huge stones at them. Most of the other stones are a permanent part of the underground cavern; while others can be used to eliminate the opponents. Money is earned after each level for the purpose of upgrading the player's vehicle. Players can improve their engines, purchase extra lives, shovels that can dig better, and weapons to improve the odds on the playing field. A kill ratio is required to be met in order to reach the next stage. Otherwise, the player remains in the current level.

After finishing all 48 levels, the game proclaims that the "battle is over" and that the player becomes "the new champion." The final scene in the game is where the player looks over the sunset with his girlfriend along with the closing credits.</desc>

    <name>Beethoven (Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>Beethoven's 2nd is a platform game where you get a chance to wear the metaphorical shoes of Beethoven - that lovable, big dog from the movie.

Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. 

Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.</desc>

Using bio-exorcist magic, players must defeat undead creatures through the cemetery and even inside the Neitherworld. Players can also ride on a mine cart and a Pogosnake (that operates in a similar fashion to Super Mario World's Yoshi). There are some elements of animated violence along with a dark Gothic theme (that explores into the realms of hauntings) in this video game.</desc>

Now Bill and Ted must travel across time to retrieve the time fragments to prevent the future from altering. But it won't be easy for the San Dimas duo. As DeNomolos has the aid of the evil robot Bill and Ted, plus he has brainwashed Death and some historical figures to stop them along the way.

Each level takes place on a single screen. Players must collect scattered time fragments while jumping platforms, climbing ladders or ropes, and avoiding enemies. Because this is a Game Boy game, all sprites are very simplistic as both Bill and Ted have almost identical game sprites. In addition, enemies are only differentiated by their actions.</desc>

    <desc>Players compete against fifteen computer opponents, including Bill Elliott, who normally wins races that the player does not. Players can choose to run a single race, or the season championship. The season championship is comprised of eight races, consisting of each of the four tracks run twice. The distances for the races is selected by the player, and ranges from 10 miles to 500 miles. Players receive points towards the championship based on the points structure of the actual NASCAR Winston Cup series. Another separate game score is tallied inside the game, awarding higher points for longer race distances chosen. A bug possibly appears in the game, as frequently when the full distance is chosen for the season championship, some races are run with extended distances.

The Game Boy version is very similar to the NES version, except that Atlanta replaced Talladega. Additionally, Pontiac is excluded and players chose between a Ford, Chevrolet or Oldsmobile.</desc>

    <name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Sailor Moon was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1992. It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.

In this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).

The three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.

By default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the "down" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.
The bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.</desc>

    <name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Sailor Moon R was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1994.

In this game, the player could play using "story mode" or "arcade mode." In story mode, the player began play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi. Gameplay alternated between a story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game are skipped.

In both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.</desc>

    <name>Black Bass - Lure Fishing (USA)</name>
    <desc>There are only two lakes to fish at and a limited set of lures; unlike the Super NES video game Super Black Bass. Casting is done on an overhead view with a meter for the direction and another meter for the shadow of the fish. Trout, pike, catfish, and the infamous black bass can all be caught in this game.

The Game Boy Color version allows players to play against 99 AI-controlled fishermen. Tournament hours are twelve non-real time hours long and all locations are fictional. Each game originally came with a 40-page instruction manual and a precautions booklet. Both versions of the game notify players when they have lost their lure and/or their fish through a text-based message. Once a player runs out of a certain kind of fishing lure, it cannot be recovered until the next gameplay.</desc>

    <desc>Blades of Steel differs from the professional game in the NHL in the late 1980s in that it has no offside rule, and its interpretation of penalties is somewhat unique. The game's officials only call two penalties. Players who lose a fistfight are penalized for two minutes, an abstract reworking of the five-minute offsetting majors normally assigned in the event of a fight. Should a fight break out in front of one team's net, then the player on offense gets a penalty shot. The penalty shot is administered in the style of a soccer penalty shot, in that the shooting player must stand on the blue line, instead of moving towards the goaltender. The game also recognizes icing infractions, with an appropriate game reset and faceoff in the liable team's zone.</desc>

    <name>Bonk's Revenge (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonkin a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.

After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.</desc>

    <name>Brain Drain (Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.

In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by "?" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the "Brain Race" available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</desc>

    <name>Bram Stoker's Dracula (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>While based on the 1992 film of the same name, the game had very little to do with the actual movie. Several weapons can be used; ranging from the basic knife to the advanced shotgun weapon.

The 16-bit renditions of the game were straightforward hack and slash games where players had to slash generic enemies in order to get to Dracula. There is a time limit that forces players to move quickly around the levels. Each chapter of the game starts off with a cover from a book. Checkpoints are used to maintain progress in a level after losing a life. Each level has a daytime and night time equivalent. A boss appears at the end of each night time level in order to test the playing skills and to reinforce the concepts that were taught in the daytime version of the level.

The player controls a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula's capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.</desc>

    <desc>In the game, the player must move the cursor amongst a grid of different colored squares. All squares must be "removed", and squares can only be removed if they are directly touching two or more squares of the same color. Once squares are removed, blocks then shift downward and either to the left or right, to fill in the blanks. The game ends when either all blocks are removed, or time has run out.

If the player comes to a point in which none of the remaining square match, a few options remain. A few "special items" help clear out blocks that don't necessarily match, such as an airplane block that eliminates a full line of square in the direction it is pointed in, or a block of dynamite that blows up every square touching it. Additionally, the player can also chose to drop new, randomly generated squares into the equation.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

    <desc>While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

    <desc>The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser, and missile weapons, which are much more powerful. The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross, and Ace; but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked. One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.</desc>

    <name>BurgerTime Deluxe (World)</name>
    <desc>Based on BurgerTime, the Arcade classic from 1982, BurgerTime Deluxe once again puts you in the role of chef Peter Pepper, a guy who can really build a burger. You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce, big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.

As you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.

Unlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played. Also, this version of the game features a two-player competitive mode (as long as you have two copies of the game, an extra Game Boy, and a link cable).</desc>

    <name>Bust-A-Move 2 - Arcade Edition (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Bust-A-Move 2 is a puzzle game that involves clearing or "popping" groups of bubbles by creating matches of three or more. A pointing device at the bottom of the screen is used to aim and launch a randomly generated bubble toward others of the same shade or pattern. Since launched bubbles can ricochet off walls, the challenge comes from estimating the angle you'll need to create potential matches. Clear each stage before the ceiling reaches the screen's bottom and you'll safely advance. The Game Boy version offers three play modes and a password save feature. You can challenge a series of 13 computer opponents, complete 100 puzzle levels, and race to clear 50 screens with the time attack option.</desc>

    <name>Bust-A-Move 3 DX (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Bust-A-Move 3 DX is the same game as Bust-A-Move '99. Besides the obvious differences because of technical limitations of the platform, e.g. the bubbles have to differentiated from of their shades instead of colour, it also has less playing modes. Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available. 

Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</desc>

    <desc>A puzzle game. The player manoeuvres the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of manoeuvres by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes.

                     The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.</desc>

    <desc>At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.</desc>

The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.

After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.</desc>

    <desc>Starring: A Boy and His Blob

The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</desc>

    <name>Dick Tracy (USA)</name>
    <desc>The game's introduction shows that Big Boy has escaped from the state penitentiary and kidnapped Tess, Tracy's love interest. The gameplay itself is purely level-based platforming, foregoing the overhead driving sequences of its NES counterpart.

Stylistically, the Game Boy version bears a strong resemblance to the side-scrolling mode of the NES version. Dick Tracy can punch and use the same weapons (hand gun, Tommy gun, tear gas), as well as grenades (which will instantly kill all non-boss enemies on the screen). This game also shares some common music with the NES version. Each of the five levels contains 12 hidden pieces of a photograph used to solve a puzzle at the end of each level.

At the end of each level, Dick Tracy would fight one of the antagonists from the film, including Shoulders, Flattop, and Pruneface). After defeating the boss, the player would need to solve the twelve-piece puzzle using the pieces found throughout the level to reveal a photo of the next boss to be pursued. If the puzzle could be solved within the allotted period of time, the player would be awarded a bonus life. For every two pieces placed correctly, the player would be awarded with one extra hit point. If any of the missing pieces were missed or if the puzzle isn't solved in time, then the game will automatically piece the whole image together (without any bonuses, of course). Then, Tracy would interrogate the fallen boss for where to search next for clues leading to Big Boy and Tess.</desc>

    <desc>The player take control of martial artist Billy Lee, who is being hunted down by an organization called the "Scorpions" for murdering one of its members. The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. Unlike the Game Boy version of the first game, a second player can now join anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.

The play mechanics are simplistic compared to previous Double Dragon games. Like in the Game Boy version of the first game, the player has a punch button and a kick button. However, instead of jumping, pressing both buttons will cause the character to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform a jumping uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly knee kick the opponent or toss them. The player may also leap over fallen opponents. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other Double Dragon games.

The game is composed of three stages, with four levels for the first two stages and two for the final stage (a total of ten levels). The third and final stage is only available when the game is played on the Normal or Hard difficulty setting.

Although it is the second Double Dragon game released for the Game Boy, it is unrelated to the arcade and NES game Double Dragon II: The Revenge.</desc>

    <desc>The game sees players in the role of Scrooge McDuck as he travels across the world in search of five treasures to further increase his fortune. Scrooge is able to attack enemies and get around using his cane. On the ground, Scrooge can swing his cane to attack enemies and break open or throw certain objects. While jumping, Scrooge can bounce on his cane like a pogo stick to attack enemies from above. This also allows him to reach higher areas, as well as bounce across hazardous areas that would hurt him on foot. Along the way, Scrooge can find various diamonds, found in treasure chests or appearing in certain areas, to increase his fortune and ice cream that can restore his health. Scrooge will also encounter various characters from the series who have various roles, such as providing hints, offering up items and opening up new areas.</desc>

    <name>F-1 Spirit (Japan)</name>
    <desc>The game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near world capitals and landmarks. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.

Gameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a "LOW" setting and a "HI" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on "skill level 1" while novices get some extra challenge on "skill level 2" and experts get the ultimate challenge on "skill level 3." A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.

Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.[citation needed] Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.</desc>

    <desc>Players practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1990 Formula One season with the exception that Circuit de Catalunya is presented in this version as the round in Spain, alltough Jerez hosted the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 335 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.

Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

    <desc>Millennia ago, a fierce battle was waged for control of an idyllic world known as Pureland. After much fighting, the brave warriors of Pureland were protectively sealed in their own dimension, away from the rest of the universe. This was done by means of Talon, a powerful space craft capable of traveling through both time and space. Centuries have passed and the would-be master of Pureland have managed to create a rift in the galaxy, sending the Pureland Water Entity to devour all that stands in its path. You must journey through past, present, and future to find the 13 pieces of the now-divided Talon. Only then can you save the universe from total destruction.</desc>

    <name>Fish Dude (USA)</name>
    <desc>Players essentially get to control Fish Dude as he eats as many tiny fish in the ocean to get bigger and stronger. Once he is strong enough, players can successfully defend themselves against larger fish, seagulls that want to grab unsuspecting players out of the water and cats that want to eat players as a tasty snack. A variety of allies (includuing Octo Dude who is an octopus) can help Fish Dude when the problems grow too intense for him to handle alone.

With only three lives to lose until achieving a "game over" screen, the game requires cunning and dexterity to master. Levels allow players to scroll of the screen at the extreme ends of the field and come back on the other side of the playing field. There are 18 levels that get more difficult as the other fish get faster and more predators are introduced in an attempt to kill off the players. Each level concludes after 20 fish have been consumed.

Passwords are introduced from the third level onwards</desc>

    <name>Flash, The (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>The game is played from the typical platform style of the scrolling side on, 2D, 3rd person viewpoint. The player controls Flash though the levels in which they must achieve 2 primary goals.
A) Find the switch which opens the level exit and then:
B) make it to the exit within the time limit.

There is also a secondary goal of collecting the gems that were stolen which increases the players score. If the player fails to make it to the exit within the time limit the FED tracks Flash down and kills him upon contact. While the player can run from the FED (giving them a last gasp effort to make it to the end of the level) due to the FED's ability to move over the screen regardless of the physical restraints that the player must encounter (e.g. walls) the player is eventually doomed to losing a life.

The FED acts as a more realistic method for imposing a time limit rather than the player just suddenly dying like in many platform games of this era.</desc>

    <name>Fushigi na Blobby - Princess Blob o Sukue! (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Starring: A Boy and His Blob

The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</desc>

    <desc>The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies. Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur). In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.</desc>

    <desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonkin a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

    <desc>The player controls a round spacecraft, and must work to clear all globes from the screen within a time limit. The playing field wraps around at the edges, so a globe or the ship travelling off the left edge (for example) will re-appear on the right. Globes come in three different colors, and those of the same color will disappear when they collide, whereas differing-colored globes will produce small pods, of the third color. Pods can be collected for more energy, but if they are not picked up quickly, they will turn into globes. There are 50 levels of increasing difficulty. On some levels, elastic bands connect certain globes, or even attach the player's ship to one or more globes. Destroying a globe will remove any elastic band attached to it. In other areas, barriers block the movement of the player and the globes. On difficulty settings above "easy", the globes are somewhat volatile. If they are not cleared within a certain time of their appearance, they will explode and damage your ship. If your ship loses enough energy, it is destroyed.</desc>

    <desc>The game is a 2D side-scrolling video game where Godzilla can only walk around or climb ladders, vines or crystals. A prominent part of the game is his punch, the only attack he has, which is used to punch and destroy boulders, and to kill or push enemies. The main point of each room is to destroy all of the boulders, by pushing them against a wall and hitting it again. Once all of the boulders are gone, one or two arrow panels will appear somewhere in the room. Touching one will take Godzilla to the room in a large map corresponding to its direction. As levels are completed, the direction is revealed on the map for further use.

There are two power-ups; the hourglass and the lightning bolt. The hourglass stops all enemy movement for a short period of time. The lightning bolt kills all enemies on-screen except for Ghidrah.</desc>

All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head.

It is addictive in its own way, since you drive a small car around a track collecting pellets and avoiding contact with the opponent's car. There are items you can collect along the way, but there are also hazards and obstacles designed to mess with your progress. There are only two game modes, one on a regular course with no items (sort of like a survival mode), and a special mode where there are items and obstacles to face. You can also play in the special mode against a second human player. It can be fun, albeit tough to put down, so give it a try!</desc>

Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.</desc>

    <desc>Prior to the start of Kirby's journey, the rainbows that connect the Rainbow Islands of Dream Land have been stolen by Dark Matter, who wants to turn the land into a dark world. He has taken control of King Dedede in order to realize his plans. Thus, Kirby and his friends set out to save Dream Land. In order to do so, they must not only overcome the mind-controlled king and his henchmen, but also recover the Rainbow Drops hidden on each island.
If Kirby fails to collect the Rainbow Drops, he walks back home in the rain after the climactic battle with Dedede, his Animal Friends following close behind. Kine eventually stops to cast a troubled look towards the sky, hinting at the fact that Dark Matter's presence is still in the air above and that Dream Land is not yet saved from the cosmic menace.
If Kirby succeeds in finding all of the Rainbow Drops and beats Dedede in battle on the roof of his Dark Castle, the drops combine to form the Rainbow Sword as Dark Matter escapes from the defeated king's body. Using the powerful sword, Kirby is able to fly high into the sky for a duel with Dark Matter himself. After emerging victorious, he briefly loses the weapon and starts plummeting to the ground in exhaustion as his friends and King Dedede watch him. However, he soon becomes fully awake again and regains the Rainbow Sword, using it to restore the rainbows that Dark Matter had stolen.</desc>

Casting is done on an overhead view with a meter for the direction and another meter for the shadow of the fish. Trout, pike, catfish, and the infamous black bass can all be caught in this game.

The Game Boy Color version allows players to play against 99 AI-controlled fishermen. Tournament hours are twelve non-real time hours long and all locations are fictional. Each game originally came with a 40-page instruction manual and a precautions booklet. Both versions of the game notify players when they have lost their lure and/or their fish through a text-based message. Once a player runs out of a certain kind of fishing lure, it cannot be recovered until the next gameplay.</desc>

    <desc>Your objective is to gather gold that is scattered on the brick platforms, which are connected by ladders. You are chased by robots (cyborgs) that end your character's life if they catch him, though you can stand on their heads. Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot's movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot's movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level. Some levels contain keys and doors which provide an alternate way to leave a level.</desc>

    <desc>Fortified Zone was ahead of its time in allowing the player to switch between characters during game play. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses: Masato (the male mercenary) uses all the special weapons, but cannot jump. Mizuki (the female mercenary) can jump, but cannot use the special weapons. A top-down shoot-'em-up, the game had four multi-room levels, titled 'Field', 'Jungle', 'Caves' and 'Complex'. At the end of each level the player faces a 'boss' character: a cannon installation, a supertank, a dragon, a bulldozer and a large assault vehicle as the final boss. Items that can be picked up in gameplay include medical packs, flamethrowers, hand grenades, rocket launchers, 3-way machine guns and chain guns.</desc>

The Earth's forces were triumphant in battle and the Grein forces fled the Solar System. However, as they retreated, the Grein left behind a secret underground base filled with self-replicating Grein machines.

Forty-two years after the Earth's victory, the Grein base opened and a new attack force decimated the city of New Age. To retaliate, Earth's military has stored a mecha that specializes in alien combat known as the Zeoth. It is the Zeoth's assignment to stop the attack force, go into the Grein secret base and destroy the mechanical occupants before a new invasion force arrives.</desc>

    <name>Jurassic Park Part 2 - The Chaos Continues (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De,It)</name>
    <desc>Jurassic Park 2 follows up its impressive cut scene with conventional side-scrolling run and gun style. The player(s) can select their level from a list and play through the game's stages in any order; however, "emergency" missions also appear after each level is completed, and the order of these stages does not change. Some stages offer a simple flat design, some have a platforming focus and others feature a maze of doorways which must be navigated to locate the exit.

Grant and Wolfskin can choose among three lethal weapons (rifle, machine gun, shotgun), and three non-lethal weapons (electric stun gun, tranquilizer gun, and gas grenade launcher). The lethal rounds are effective against humans and dinosaurs, while the non-lethal rounds are designed to incapacitate dinosaurs without killing them, so as to preserve InGen's investment; if the number of dinosaurs killed with lethal weapons by the player becomes too high, the game will end. Non-lethal rounds do not affect humans, while killing Raptors with lethal rounds will not affect the number of dinosaurs killed.</desc>

    <desc>The game is set in the Greek mythological fantasy world Angel Land that is ruled by the goddess Palutena. Its story is detailed in the instruction booklet: Palutena has a nightmare, which a soothsayer interprets as a foreshadowing of an invasion by the demon Orcos and his minions. The goddess summons Pit  the leader of her army  and commands him to enter a special training that will give him the power to use Angel Land's three sacred treasures. To keep these safe from Orcos while Pit is on his mission, Palutena has them protected by three fortress guardians. After Pit has finished his training and defeated the guardians, the goddess equips him with the sacred treasures. Orcos appears and turns Palutena to stone, but Pit defeats him and saves her, restoring peace to Angel Land. In the ending, Pit soars into the sky. As in the Greek myth of Icarus, he flies too close to the sun and loses his wings.</desc>

    <name>Kingdom Crusade (USA)</name>
    <desc>This video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army.  Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens.

Even though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai).  All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing).

Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent.  Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.</desc>

    <desc>The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.</desc>

    <desc>Prior to the start of Kirby's journey, the rainbows that connect the Rainbow Islands of Dream Land have been stolen by Dark Matter, who wants to turn the land into a dark world. He has taken control of King Dedede in order to realize his plans. Thus, Kirby and his friends set out to save Dream Land. In order to do so, they must not only overcome the mind-controlled king and his henchmen, but also recover the Rainbow Drops hidden on each island.
If Kirby fails to collect the Rainbow Drops, he walks back home in the rain after the climactic battle with Dedede, his Animal Friends following close behind. Kine eventually stops to cast a troubled look towards the sky, hinting at the fact that Dark Matter's presence is still in the air above and that Dream Land is not yet saved from the cosmic menace.
If Kirby succeeds in finding all of the Rainbow Drops and beats Dedede in battle on the roof of his Dark Castle, the drops combine to form the Rainbow Sword as Dark Matter escapes from the defeated king's body. Using the powerful sword, Kirby is able to fly high into the sky for a duel with Dark Matter himself. After emerging victorious, he briefly loses the weapon and starts plummeting to the ground in exhaustion as his friends and King Dedede watch him. However, he soon becomes fully awake again and regains the Rainbow Sword, using it to restore the rainbows that Dark Matter had stolen.</desc>

    <desc>Blades of Steel differs from the professional game in the NHL in the late 1980s in that it has no offside rule, and its interpretation of penalties is somewhat unique. The game's officials only call two penalties. Players who lose a fistfight are penalized for two minutes, an abstract reworking of the five-minute offsetting majors normally assigned in the event of a fight. Should a fight break out in front of one team's net, then the player on offense gets a penalty shot. The penalty shot is administered in the style of a soccer penalty shot, in that the shooting player must stand on the blue line, instead of moving towards the goaltender. The game also recognizes icing infractions, with an appropriate game reset and faceoff in the liable team's zone.</desc>

    <desc>Last Action Hero blasts you out of the real world - onto the silver screen - and back again, in a non-stop action-adventure based on the epic fantasy feature starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. As movie hero Jack Slater, you'll team up with your biggest fan, Danny Madigan, who's got a magic movie ticket that's the ticket to serious trouble. Leaping between both the movie world and the real world with this magic ticket, you'll get into wild chases and deadly fights with the most dangerous criminals imaginable. Last Action Hero delivers all the excitement of the Schwarzenegger film with just one difference... you're the star! But this time, you must ultimately defeat the arch henchman Benedict to ensure a happy ending.</desc>

    <name>Lawnmower Man, The (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

    <name>Legend of Prince Valiant, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De)</name>
    <desc>This video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army.  Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens.

Even though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai).  All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing).

Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent.  Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.</desc>

This classic arcade game invites you to play as a thief who's trying to score big by collecting his weight in gold. Duck in and out of alleys while scooping up coins along the way. Maybe you'll get lucky and find some extra treasure. But being on the wrong side of the law is never easy, as the police are hot on your tail. If you think they're coming too close, try using a sliding door or power-up items to block their chase.

Think you can make a clean getaway? Test your skills in Lock'N Chase.</desc>

    <desc>Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers/defenders, and three midfielders). When the player moves a row, all of them are moved at once unlike on an actual table soccer set. Rows cannot be moved in an upward or a downward position; only from left to right. Stopping the ball and performing powerful shots is only one aspect of the game. Players can also incapacitate one of the opposing players on a well-timed shot. A tied game results in a penalty shootout.

Three different surfaces are available. Players can practice without a computer opponent and a spectator mode allows newcomers to see two computer-controller opponents face off.</desc>

    <desc>Set in the 21st century ("200X"), Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge follows the storyline of the original Mega Man series. The titular protagonist Mega Man, a super robot created by the benevolent Dr. Light, has restored peace to the world by halting the plans of the evil Dr. Wily and his powerful "Robot Masters". In Dr. Wily's Revenge, the mad scientist returns to send eight of his old Robot Masters to contend with the hero once again. After vanquishing four of the Robot Masters, Mega Man heads to Wily's fortress and deals with the remaining half of them. The protagonist then battles a new robot designed solely for destroying him, the "Mega Man Killer" Enker. As Mega Man defeats Enker and obtains his Mirror Buster ability, Wily retreats to a space station. Mega Man gives chase and, using the Mirror Buster, destroys Wily's newly-built, final weapon. After putting a stop to his arch nemesis once again, Mega Man travels back home via space shuttle.</desc>

    <desc>The plot of the game one again involves the protagonist Mega Man trying to thwart the world domination plans of the infamous Dr. Wily. On a seemingly peaceful day in a large city, Wily appears in the sky in his flying saucer and sends out a radio transmission that causes all the robots at the annual Robot Master Exposition to go on a rampage. He then sends eight new rebuilt robots of his own to different parts of the city to lead the destruction. Having resisted this reprogramming signal, Mega Man responds by defeating all four of these previous foes in battle and chases Wily to a large tank. Inside the tank, the hero encounters Ballade, yet another robot specially designed to kill him. Mega Man defeats this new enemy, pursues the remaining enemies in the city, and returns to the tank. There, he has a victorious rematch with Ballade, only to see Wily quickly retreat to his space station. Dr. Light fits Mega Man's companion Rush with a space flight ability, allowing the hero to lead a one-man assault on Wily's new stronghold. Mega Man beats Wily, but is unable to blast his way out of the exploding space station. At the last moment, Ballade arrives and self-destructs in repentance, creating a hole through which Mega Man can safely escape.</desc>

    <desc>Over one hundred years ago during the mighty Shogun era, the Lord of Darkness sent his fearsome army to terrorize the Japanese countryside. Using the Dark Lord's powerful magic, his evil minions spread famine, plague, and pestilence wherever they went, leaving the peaceful population hopelessly oppressed. All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord. He immediately set out to recruit the five bravest and most skillful fighters in the land. After months of searching he was finally ready to put his dream into action.

    <desc>While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

    <desc>One day, Mickey and his friends went for a walk in a forest. They became so distracted by all the natural beauty surrounding them, they got lost. Pretty soon, they discovered a haunted castle. "That's the witch Yashja's castle," they told each other. "Once you enter, you can never escape! The castle is full of tricks and traps and even magic wands to create ice and fire. Let's not get any closer!"

All this chatter aroused Yashja from her slumber. "So! Who dares disturb my sleep?" she yelled. "You all shall pay!" Suddenly, a gaping hole opened up under Mickey's friends and they all fell in. Now Mickey has to save his friends, who are now being held captive by the witch!

To save his friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from the comic book series. To do this, Mickey has to wave his wand over crystals which conceal not only pieces of the image, but also items and even an occasional enemy. Each big level has ten small stages, each with at least one image to complete. Each tenth stage has an end boss to defeat. Also, the image to complete in the tenth stage of each level reveals the Disney character being held captive by the end boss of that level.</desc>

To save his friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from the comic book series. To do this, Mickey has to wave his wand over crystals which conceal not only pieces of the image, but also items and even an occasional enemy. Each big level has ten small stages, each with at least one image to complete. Each tenth stage has an end boss to defeat. Also, the image to complete in the tenth stage of each level reveals the Disney character being held captive by the end boss of that level.</desc>

The gameplay is a general side-scrolling action game where players destroy enemies with Super Mario World-like blocks.

There are items that grant temporary invincibility along with a 1-up and boosts to the player's health.Players have to navigate a lake, the summit of a mountain, through a vast forest, and even stroll through the shopping center while avoiding insects, small mammals, and snowballs. All of these enemies appear in their appropriate levels (i.e., no ghosts in the town level, no flying squirrels in the haunted house level.

The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.</desc>

    <desc>Following his failure to defeat to Liu Kang in the first Mortal Kombat game, the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung begs his master, Shao Kahn, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

    <desc>The player's control over the motorcycle allows moving the front wheel upwards or downwards, allowing for jumps over obstacles and rotating stunts when in the air. If the player lands incorrectly, the rider will fall off his bike and climb back on it. This results in the main cause of time loss within the game.

The motorbike also has the ability to use a limited amount of "Nitros" which provide a short speed boost. This allows for large jumps and can be necessary for making loops.

Additional sets of nitros can be picked up within a level (marked as a large "N"), but often they will require a nitro to be used to get them in the first place. Thus when the player has exhausted his supply, it can be very hard or even impossible to regain more nitros. Furthermore, some levels have sections that require one or more nitros to pass, making it nearly impossible to complete the level without any.

Other power-ups in the game include more time (marked as "T"), more speed (marked as "S", continues until the player crashes) and special tires (marked as "R", also continues until the player crashes).

One can also retrieve powerups by making frontflips and backflips, and even a jetpack that allows you to rocket up high if several nitros are used.

Many levels offer multiple directions for the player. One usually contains extra powerups that requires the use of nitros and agility to successfully traverse, while the other simply requires jumping obstacles on the ground, often including loose sand and gravel that will slow down the motorcycle.</desc>

    <desc>Getting your helmet split by a blind sided hit has never been so much fun!
NFL Football puts the pressure on your shoulder pads to carry both the pro-style offense and defense.
When driving for the end zone, you'll call every shot, firing bullets and bombs to your favorite receivers. Or run bootlegs, blasting upfield behind snarling, thick-necked blockers.
Then on defense, chosse every attack formation and position yourself as a tenacious head banger, going the pigskin by blitzing or picking-off lame ducks.
First downs, four quarters, kickoffs, punts, field goals, extra points, stats...everything's here but the bruises. You can even star on your favorite NFL franchise, since al 28 teams are here, ready to replay their rowdy rivalries.
So pull down your face mask, tape your fingers, and grind it out on this Game Boy game breaker.</desc>

    <desc>The player take control of martial artist Billy Lee, who is being hunted down by an organization called the "Scorpions" for murdering one of its members. The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. Unlike the Game Boy version of the first game, a second player can now join anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.

The play mechanics are simplistic compared to previous Double Dragon games. Like in the Game Boy version of the first game, the player has a punch button and a kick button. However, instead of jumping, pressing both buttons will cause the character to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform a jumping uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly knee kick the opponent or toss them. The player may also leap over fallen opponents. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other Double Dragon games.

The game is composed of three stages, with four levels for the first two stages and two for the final stage (a total of ten levels). The third and final stage is only available when the game is played on the Normal or Hard difficulty setting.

Although it is the second Double Dragon game released for the Game Boy, it is unrelated to the arcade and NES game Double Dragon II: The Revenge.</desc>

    <name>Nettou World Heroes 2 Jet (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
    <desc>World Heroes 2 Jet, initially released in 1994, is the 3rd in the prolific fighting game series. Choose from 16 historical or well-known heroes, villains and fighters and battle your way to the top to become the world's greatest warrior! There are two types of modes in this version, "Tournament of Titans Mode", where you fight three bouts in one day, and if you are successful you move on to the next day, and "World Heroes Training Mode", where you can fight with any opponent. Furthermore, the addition of dash and back step, which were not in the previous version, as well as a countering system that ushers in a more speedy way of fighting, makes World Heroes 2 Jet even more enjoyable to play. There are also four competition types to choose from, allowing for even more in-depth battles.</desc>

There are a certain amount of lines with switches and dots that need activating.[3] Once all the lines are cleared, so are any enemies that are remaining in that level. A strict time limit make players lose their lives in addition to bumping into an enemy.

There is no regularity to the movement of the character, giving an element of luck to the game. Some aspects of background graphics appear in certain levels (especially on levels 12, 20, 28, and 36).  Level 40 is essentially a giant maze which leads up to a castle that ends the game.</desc>

    <desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.</desc>

The player is able to possess enemies, 20 in all, and use any skills or weapons they have, to complete the level.

Also exclusive to Japan, Nintendo released 8 volumes of Nintendo Power branded Picross games known as Picross NP that were only available via the Nintendo Power service. The game was released on the 3DS Virtual Console.</desc>

    <name>Pitman (Japan)</name>
    <desc>A puzzle game. The player manoeuvres the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of manoeuvres by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes.

                     The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.</desc>

    <desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football. While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

    <desc>Game Boy version of the second installment of the Puyo Puyo games; the sequel to Puyo Puyo, made in 1994 by Compile. It also supports Super Game Boy technology.
The name of this game comes from an English pun, as "tsuu" ( ts, meaning "Expert") when spoken aloud sounds similar to the English word "two".
Just like the prequel, Puyo fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise by 90; if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over. Different rules however played a factor within the game. The game also has different styles of playing for each version, including its newer features.</desc>

    <name>Popeye (Japan)</name>
    <desc>This game was released only in Japan.
The scenario is a maze and the player controls Popeye who has a time limit to collect some hearts, find Olive Oyl and save Swee'Pea which only appears somewhere to be saved after the hearts were collected and Olive found.
Popeye should avoid Bluto in order to prevent a fight with him, not losing time. When the fight is inevitable, and if Olive is already found, Popeye will lose her, and after the fight ends, he has to find her again. Bluto can drop weapons and enemies such as cannons and animals. He also steals the hearts and when it happens the heart will appear somewhere else to be collected. J. Wellington Wimpy is always wandering around and puts hamburgers that eventually block Popeye's path, however he can put so much as remove by eating them. A "flying" can of spinach will sometimes appear during the game anytime and out of nowhere, and can be used to increase Popeye's strength: be faster and the ability to eliminate enemies released by Bluto and Wimpy's hamburgers that obstruct the path. There are three playable courses and each one has five stages. In the game ending, Popeye gets married to Olive Oyl in front of a church.
Bluto is a playable character in the multiplayer-mode.</desc>

    <desc>Power Racer is a racing game which takes obvious game elements from Pac-Man.  It is addictive in its own way, since you drive a small car around a track collecting pellets and avoiding contact with the opponent's car. There are items you can collect along the way, but there are also hazards and obstacles designed to mess with your progress. There are only two game modes, one on a regular course with no items (sort of like a survival mode), and a special mode where there are items and obstacles to face. You can also play in the special mode against a second human player. It can be fun, albeit tough to put down, so give it a try!</desc>

    <desc>Bust-A-Move 2 is a puzzle game that involves clearing or "popping" groups of bubbles by creating matches of three or more. A pointing device at the bottom of the screen is used to aim and launch a randomly generated bubble toward others of the same shade or pattern. Since launched bubbles can ricochet off walls, the challenge comes from estimating the angle you'll need to create potential matches. Clear each stage before the ceiling reaches the screen's bottom and you'll safely advance. The Game Boy version offers three play modes and a password save feature. You can challenge a series of 13 computer opponents, complete 100 puzzle levels, and race to clear 50 screens with the time attack option.</desc>

Kwirk has three skill levels: Level 1 - Easy, Level 2 - Average and Level 3 - Hard. After, one of two viewpoints may be selected: Diagonal or Bird's Eye. In Diagonal view, characters and blocks have shadows and appear in crude 3D, whereas in Bird's Eye view everything is 2D, viewed from the top down.

    <desc>This puzzle-game is the successor to Kwirk. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable. Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors.

The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</desc>

    <desc>Hop Q*bert up and down the steps of a "three-dimensional" pyramid, changing each step's color as he lands. Complete the entire pyramid, and Q*bert moves to a more challenging pyramid. But look out! The crafty arcade creatures are here, too, and they're after Q*bert. Hop out of danger fast - or soar to safety on a flying disc. But watch where you move Q*bert. One hop off the pyramid and he'll be lost in space!</desc>

    <desc>QIX - it's sneaky, it's snakey, it's an unpredictable energy field! It rotates, stretches, shortens and changes directions in a flash. QIX tries to catch your diamond cursor before you complete a box. Once the box is complete you've taken over that part of the screen. But watch the moving sparks. If they catch you, it'll be over in an instant. When you claim 75% or more of the screen, you win the round. Each level is more difficult, with more sparks to dodge and two QIX's to challenge you!</desc>

    <name>R-Type II (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The game is the sequel to R-Type, which was first released as an arcade game in 1987 and profoundly influenced later shooting games with its charge shots, unique weaponry, and grotesque enemies. Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the TurboGrafx-16 with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.

The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.

Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.</desc>

    <desc>Set in the 21st century ("200X"), Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge follows the storyline of the original Mega Man series. The titular protagonist Mega Man, a super robot created by the benevolent Dr. Light, has restored peace to the world by halting the plans of the evil Dr. Wily and his powerful "Robot Masters". In Dr. Wily's Revenge, the mad scientist returns to send eight of his old Robot Masters to contend with the hero once again. After vanquishing four of the Robot Masters, Mega Man heads to Wily's fortress and deals with the remaining half of them. The protagonist then battles a new robot designed solely for destroying him, the "Mega Man Killer" Enker. As Mega Man defeats Enker and obtains his Mirror Buster ability, Wily retreats to a space station. Mega Man gives chase and, using the Mirror Buster, destroys Wily's newly-built, final weapon. After putting a stop to his arch nemesis once again, Mega Man travels back home via space shuttle.</desc>

This time around the evil genius has stolen an experimental "Time Skimmer" from the world's Chronos Institute and used it to travel 37.426 years into the future. Meanwhile, Mega Man is sent to investigate an underground passageway containing enemy Robot Masters from his previous adventures. Mega Man destroys them again and makes his way to Wily's fortress, which contains four more Robot Masters from his past. Once they are destroyed, Mega Man advances and comes upon Quint, a future version of himself. Wily had captured Quint in the future, remodeled him, and brought him back to the present. After Mega Man beats him, Quint relinquishes his "Sakugarne" jackhammer weapon to the hero. Mega Man follows Wily to a space station and defeats him.</desc>

After annihilating eight robots whom Wily had previously used, Mega Man makes his way to Wily's lab, where he encounters the mad doctor attempting to escape. A powerful robot designed specifically to destroy the hero, Punk, confronts Mega Man but is defeated.

    <desc>The plot of the game one again involves the protagonist Mega Man trying to thwart the world domination plans of the infamous Dr. Wily. On a seemingly peaceful day in a large city, Wily appears in the sky in his flying saucer and sends out a radio transmission that causes all the robots at the annual Robot Master Exposition to go on a rampage. He then sends eight new rebuilt robots of his own to different parts of the city to lead the destruction. Having resisted this reprogramming signal, Mega Man responds by defeating all four of these previous foes in battle and chases Wily to a large tank. Inside the tank, the hero encounters Ballade, yet another robot specially designed to kill him. Mega Man defeats this new enemy, pursues the remaining enemies in the city, and returns to the tank. There, he has a victorious rematch with Ballade, only to see Wily quickly retreat to his space station. Dr. Light fits Mega Man's companion Rush with a space flight ability, allowing the hero to lead a one-man assault on Wily's new stronghold. Mega Man beats Wily, but is unable to blast his way out of the exploding space station. At the last moment, Ballade arrives and self-destructs in repentance, creating a hole through which Mega Man can safely escape.</desc>

Mega Man and his sister Roll are strolling through a grassy field, when suddenly, they are confronted by a mysterious new robot who calls himself Terra. Mega Man attempts to fight Terra, only to find that his "Mega Buster" arm cannon has no effect on this new powerful enemy. Mega Man is knocked unconscious, and two groups of powerful robots calling themselves the "Stardroids" attack Earth, defeating numerous robots, including Robot Masters from previous Mega Man games. Waking up in Dr. Light's laboratory, Mega Man is presented with the new and powerful "Mega Arm" to help him fight the Stardroids in his newest mission to save the planet.</desc>

    <path>./Rod Land (Europe).zip</path>
    <name>Rod Land (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The player(s) control one or two fairies called Tam and Rit armed with a magic wand (rod). Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.

Each level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.

The fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil force that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father "guides" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the evil in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death.</desc>

    <desc>Millennia ago, a fierce battle was waged for control of an idyllic world known as Pureland. After much fighting, the brave warriors of Pureland were protectively sealed in their own dimension, away from the rest of the universe. This was done by means of Talon, a powerful space craft capable of traveling through both time and space. Centuries have passed and the would-be master of Pureland have managed to create a rift in the galaxy, sending the Pureland Water Entity to devour all that stands in its path. You must journey through past, present, and future to find the 13 pieces of the now-divided Talon. Only then can you save the universe from total destruction.</desc>

    <desc>The game merges the existing universe of The Simpsons television series with the fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk. In the story, Bart Simpson goes to market to sell the family cow, but is swindled by a clever miser (played in the game by the character Mr. Burns) who trades it for magical beans and a slingshot. When Bart takes the magic beans home his father Homer Simpson accidentally eats them and spits them outside. A beanstalk grows, Bart climbs to the top, and adventures in a giant castle ensue. Bart meets several characters from The Simpsons on these adventures.

The Simpsons: Bart &amp; the Beanstalk is a side-scrolling platform game. It is single-player only. The player of the game controls Bart in a total of seven levels. They are: "Up the Beanstalk", "Outside the Castle", "The Giant's Cupboard", "Soup Du Jour", "The Giant's Room", "Escape from the Castle", and "Down the Beanstalk". In order to complete a level, the player must collect a certain amount of gold coins. Bart is faced with a number of enemies on every level, and he can use his slingshot to fend them off. He can also pick up dynamite, which kills all enemies currently on the screen. The enemies featured in the game include beetles, hornets, flies, ducks, rats, and fire flies.

    <name>Simpsons, The - Bart no Jack to Mame no Ki (Japan)</name>
    <desc>The game merges the existing universe of The Simpsons television series with the fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk. In the story, Bart Simpson goes to market to sell the family cow, but is swindled by a clever miser (played in the game by the character Mr. Burns) who trades it for magical beans and a slingshot. When Bart takes the magic beans home his father Homer Simpson accidentally eats them and spits them outside. A beanstalk grows, Bart climbs to the top, and adventures in a giant castle ensue. Bart meets several characters from The Simpsons on these adventures.

The Simpsons: Bart &amp; the Beanstalk is a side-scrolling platform game. It is single-player only. The player of the game controls Bart in a total of seven levels. They are: "Up the Beanstalk", "Outside the Castle", "The Giant's Cupboard", "Soup Du Jour", "The Giant's Room", "Escape from the Castle", and "Down the Beanstalk". In order to complete a level, the player must collect a certain amount of gold coins. Bart is faced with a number of enemies on every level, and he can use his slingshot to fend them off. He can also pick up dynamite, which kills all enemies currently on the screen. The enemies featured in the game include beetles, hornets, flies, ducks, rats, and fire flies. On some levels, Bart also has to defeat a boss.</desc>

    <desc>It's hard to imagine the little blue creatures as anything less than the happiest things in the world, but terror has fallen on their precious village. Gargamel has cast a wicked spell (doesn't this guys have anything better to do?) and now the Smurfs are trapped inside of all their worst nightmares! Only Hefty has been spared, and you'll control the brave fellow through each level of his peers' worst trepidations, attempting to rescue each Smurf individually. The spooky happenings have all unfolded on the night of a full moon, making things even more frightening. There are 16 levels in all, and each is packed with unique enemies and obstacles that will give you a run for your money, and the graphics are vintage SMURFS all the way. Two levels of difficulty allow less experienced gamers to ease into play, and all progress can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>

    <name>Spirit of F-1, The (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near world capitals and landmarks. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.

Gameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a "LOW" setting and a "HI" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on "skill level 1" while novices get some extra challenge on "skill level 2" and experts get the ultimate challenge on "skill level 3." A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.

Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.[citation needed] Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.</desc>

    <desc>The Game Boy version of Street Fighter II was released on August 11, 1995 in Japan and on September 1995 internationally. It is missing three of the original characters (E. Honda, Dhalsim and Vega), although the remaining nine are all playable. The graphics, character portraits, and backgrounds are based on Super Street Fighter II, although some moves (such as Blanka's Amazon River Run) from Super Street Fighter II Turbo are included as well. Since the Game Boy only features two buttons, the strength of a player's punches and kicks are determined by how long the player hold either button (an input method similar to the one used in Fighting Street, the TurboGrafx CD version of the original Street Fighter). Same character matches are allowed, but because of the game's lack of color, distinguishing between two characters is not possible even on a Super Game Boy.</desc>

    <desc>he game takes place immediately after its predecessor, James Pond. Although Acme Oil Co. has been destroyed by James Pond, Pond's arch enemy Dr. Maybe survived and has retreated to the North Pole where he has taken over Santa's workshop. Dr. Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name "RoboCod" (a pun on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.</desc>

    <name>Super Mario Land (World) (Rev A)</name>
    <desc>The gameplay of Super Mario Land is similar to that of Super Mario Bros. and its Japanese successor for the Nintendo Entertainment System. As in the previous games, the player takes over the role of Mario. The ultimate objective is to defeat Tatanga, the "Mysterious Spaceman," and save Princess Daisy. However, there are some differences from earlier Mario games as well.

Mario's primary attack is to jump on top of his enemies, which normally kills them. However, there are a few antagonists who cannot be undone in this manner or may even cause damage to Mario if he jumps on them. Power-ups like the Super Mushroom work normally, but the Fire Flower enables Mario to throw "superballs" that fly at a 45-degree angle and ricochet off floors, walls, and ceilings. Unlike traditional fireballs, Superballs can also be used to collect coins, which is useful for coins that are difficult or impossible to reach otherwise. Also, unlike other games in the series, gameplay doesn't pause briefly when Mario collects a power-up or takes damage.

In two specific levels Mario flies in the "Sky Pop" aeroplane or travels in the "Marine Pop" submarine instead of walking. In these levels, there is no Super Flower because Mario can shoot the entire time. He still can grow by getting a Super Mushroom or become invincible by getting a Starman. During these levels, the screen constantly scrolls forward until it reaches the boss at the end, and it is not possible to slow down or stop it. Mario can be killed either by an enemy or by being crushed by the edge of the screen.

The game consists of four worlds with three levels each. At the end of every level, there is a tower with an access at the top and at the bottom. If Mario can reach the upper access, there is a bonus level in which the player can win extra lives or power-ups. If he only reaches the lower access, the game continues normally. At the end of every third level, Mario has to fight a boss by either battling it or getting around it to reach a point behind them that will end the battle, similar to fighting Bowser in the original Super Mario Bros. After the game is completed, the game returns to the title screen, and the player is given the option to play in "Hard Mode." If the game is finished in Hard Mode, the game goes back to the title screen and allows the player to choose which stage to start in, allowing for replay of any particular stage.</desc>

    <name>Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins (USA, Europe) (Rev A)</name>
    <desc>The objective of Super Mario Land 2 is to reach the end of each level, defeating or avoiding enemies while doing so. The game retains several enemies from the Mario series, such as the Goomba and the Koopa, and also introduces several new enemies. Enemies can usually be defeated by jumping on their head, but also may need to be defeated in different ways, such as a fireball. Other famous mechanics include Warp Pipes, which allow the player to enter hidden areas or find shortcuts, coins, and ? Blocks, which hide coins and items. Unlike in previous Mario games, coins are not used to get lives; instead, they are used to play games in a special area that awards lives and other power-ups. To gain lives, instead, the player must find hearts like they did in the original. After killing 100 enemies, a star comes flying down which provides a short period of invincibility. The star can also be found at other places in the game. While being invincible, the 5th and each subsequent enemy killed will provide one life.

While its predecessor was similar to the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Land 2 has more in common with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World: The player is no longer restricted to moving right in a level, and any level (except for the introductory stage) can be replayed. At the end of a level, there is a door that must be touched to clear a level. In addition, there is also a bell above the door which, if touched, activates a mini-game where the player can try to get either a power-up or extra lives.

There are 32 levels in total, based in several different themed zones. Some of the levels can only be accessed by entering in secret exits found in regular levels. Once the player clears or loses a life in these secret levels, he or she is returned to the level where the secret exit was found. Each zone has its own boss, which must be defeated to get one of the 6 Coins. If the player loses all of Mario's lives, all of the 6 Coins are returned to the bosses, which must be defeated again to retrieve the coins.

Super Mario Land 2 features three returning power-upsthe Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman. The Super Mushroom increases Mario's size, the Fire Flower gives him the ability to shoot fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario invincible to anything besides pits. Both the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower also allow Mario to do a spin jump like in Super Mario World. Due to the grayscale palette, Fire Mario is differentiated from Super Mario by having a feather in his cap, a feature not seen in any other Mario series game. Also unique to Super Mario Land 2 is the Magic Carrot power-up, which turns Mario into Bunny Mario. Bunny Mario can jump higher, jump repeatedly by holding down the jump button, and descend slowly using his ear (Interestingly, this shows a similarity to the "Super Leaf" power-up in Super Mario Bros. 3).

Like Super Mario World, instead of going through a series of stages through each world, the player navigates a large overworld map that contains an additional map for each world with its own series of stages followed by a boss. However, the six worlds can be played in any order unlike in most Mario games that feature overworld maps. The game also saves the player's progress after beating a stage, though this is the first Mario game released to a portable console to have a save feature.</desc>

Bunny Mario can jump higher, jump repeatedly by holding down the jump button, and descend slowly using his ear (Interestingly, this shows a similarity to the "Super Leaf" power-up in Super Mario Bros. 3).

Like Super Mario World, instead of going through a series of stages through each world, the player navigates a large overworld map that contains an additional map for each world with its own series of stages followed by a boss. However, the six worlds can be played in any order unlike in most Mario games that feature overworld maps. The game also saves the player's progress after beating a stage, though this is the first Mario game released to a portable console to have a save feature.</desc>

    <name>Super R.C. Pro-Am (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Super R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.
Each track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and "slow cones" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: "zippers" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performancetires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.
Players have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling "Nintendo" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the "Racer" to the "Speed demon" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell "Nintendo" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.</desc>

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

To rescue this ravishing reporter, you must return to the sewers and dredge forth those reptiles with a penchant for pizza and all the nifty knifework of a chop suey chef.

Of course, this once in a light year adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5 never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you'll perfect the ancient art of icing, dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you'll get the chance to wipe the smirks off the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and that nasty villain Filet O'Filth. So get back into your shell and start snapping away, before April goes from delivering the news to singing the blues in some new cement shoes.</desc>

    <desc>Over one hundred years ago during the mighty Shogun era, the Lord of Darkness sent his fearsome army to terrorize the Japanese countryside. Using the Dark Lord's powerful magic, his evil minions spread famine, plague, and pestilence wherever they went, leaving the peaceful population hopelessly oppressed. All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord. He immediately set out to recruit the five bravest and most skillful fighters in the land. After months of searching he was finally ready to put his dream into action. It was time to unleash the Mercenary Force.</desc>

The game includes three different gameplay modes: Normal mode has you clearing out each stage with a never-ending supply of blocks; in Puzzle mode, youre challenged to clear out the stage with a specific number of blocks; and theres also a Head-to-Head mode, where you can play against a human or computer opponent in a battle to the finish.</desc>

    <desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.</desc>

    <desc>The player takes control of Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, or Hamton J. Pig as they attempt to prevent Montana Max from thwarting Babs Bunny's dreams of becoming a big star. There are four stages, of which throughout, a special helper (Dizzy Devil, Furrball, Fifi La Fume, or Shirley the Loon) assists. Along the way are others that are a hindrance, such as Elmyra Duff, Arnold the Pit Bull, Roderick Rat and others.

Each of the three player characters has different weapons. Buster's carrots fly in an arc, Plucky throws pineapples that can bounce off the background, and Hamton throws watermelons that roll along the ground. The player can also collect various power-ups. Small hearts restore one heart. Large hearts will increase the player's life meter by one heart for the remainder of the level.

Gems can be collected and spent playing mini-games for more power-ups or extra lives. However, the player loses half of their gems when losing a life. If the player has collected 500 or more gems upon reaching the fight with Montana Max, he will offer to sell the theatre to the player. However, this will only result in an alternate dialogue sequence, and the player will need to fight Montana Max. There is secret code that can be entered at the beginning of the game.</desc>

It's up to Buster Bunny to go into the films and change the plots. Buster is assisted by the crazy Gogo Dodo, and will encounter him in each movie, where he can get assistance from each of his friends.

At the end of each stage, Montana Max appears in a themed costume for each film, and challenges Buster to battle. Of course, other famous foes of Buster's will be there to try to stop him, including Roderick Rat.

There are five stages, with the first four being different films that Montana's showing, and the final stage is being held in the backlots of Montana's movie studio. Buster simply has to go through the stages before the time runs out. Collecting carrots along the way earns Buster extra lives and bonus points. By the end of a stage, Buster confronts Max as a boss. Defeating him, requires Buster to stomp on him five times. In between stages, Buster can participate in a bonus sports game against one of his friends or rivals.</desc>

Every location is an adventure in itself, filed with hidden dangers and wild surprisesespecially that crafty ol' cat, Tom! And once you make it inside the house, the action really heats up in the Kitchen and on into the Living Room, where a whole lot of trouble stands between you and your mouse hole.</desc>

    <name>Trip World (Europe)</name>
    <desc>In the early 1990s Sunsoft was at its best, developing many fine platformers, several of which were even licensed properties. Its Batman games were almost all excellent, especially the Game Boy release, which combined Mario-style platforms and blockbusting with gunplay. Much of Sunsoft's NES catalogue is also fondly remembered, with titles such as Blaster Master, Journey to Silius and, despite its obscene difficulty, Mr. Gimmick / Gimmick! to name a few. Trip World for the Game Boy is another Sunsoft goodie, regularly featuring on lists for obscure or overlooked games and, in the US at least, lists for import exclusives. Released only in Japan and Europe in small quantities, a boxed copy of the original cartridge now sells for ludicrously high prices. At the time of writing, two unboxed copies were on eBay for around 115 / $180; Yahoo! Auctions Japan had nothing.

Trip World at first appears to be like any conventional platformer  perhaps a little too conventional. There's an intro showing the Maita Flower from atop Mount Dubious being stolen from an elderly Shabubu who is also kidnapped (a bunny-like creature not to be confused with the culinary shabu-shabu dish). Cue the old creature's grandson, Yacopu, to venture out, save his grandfather and retrieve the flower, thereby bringing peace back to the world. Players move across the screen, avoiding spike pits, jumping along collapsing platforms, and karate kicking enemies... Except the enemies don't seem to fight back. Very few of them in fact cause any damage at all, with only the bosses posing a genuine threat. Apart from the harmless enemies, it's all very standard. Yacopu can collect fruit items which imbue him with special powers: the ability to fire paralysing seeds that sprout from the skulls of enemies; a bouncy ball power-up; and a third which allows him to attack with his tail. These powers are timed and soon wear off, but in some stages it's possible to collect an additional power-up which, when combined with the first, grants something entirely new. The best of which causes Yacopu to sprout legs and gain the ability to fire instant-death projectiles.</desc>

    <desc>Players essentially get to control Fish Dude as he eats as many tiny fish in the ocean to get bigger and stronger. Once he is strong enough, players can successfully defend themselves against larger fish, seagulls that want to grab unsuspecting players out of the water and cats that want to eat players as a tasty snack. A variety of allies (includuing Octo Dude who is an octopus) can help Fish Dude when the problems grow too intense for him to handle alone.

With only three lives to lose until achieving a "game over" screen, the game requires cunning and dexterity to master. Levels allow players to scroll of the screen at the extreme ends of the field and come back on the other side of the playing field. There are 18 levels that get more difficult as the other fish get faster and more predators are introduced in an attempt to kill off the players. Each level concludes after 20 fish have been consumed.

Passwords are introduced from the third level onwards</desc>

    <path>./Virtual Wars (Japan).zip</path>
    <name>Virtual Wars (Japan)</name>
    <desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

    <desc>WCW: The Main Event is a professional wrestling video game released in 1994 by FCI for the Nintendo Game Boy portable video game system. It was just the second video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and the first of two released to a handheld console.

Gameplay

There are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one, three, or five) and a set time limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.
Throwing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters.
[edit]Wrestlers

These wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).</desc>

    <desc>Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 starts at the end of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. Wario Land features a theme of greed remarkably different from almost all of Nintendo's other franchises: It is the first game Nintendo has made where the main character's cause is decidedly selfish. There are no princesses to save, no world in peril. There is only one goal: for Wario to earn as much money as possible, in an effort to buy his own massive castle and make Mario jealous. The larger the cash total Wario has collected at the end of the game, the better house (and ending) that Wario will receive.

The Super Mario Land 3 subtitle links the game with the popular Super Mario Land 2. The game also increases its replay value by including a large hidden treasure chest in some levels. The chests (which can only be accessed by finding a special key placed elsewhere in the level) contain special one-of-a-kind treasures, which would each add a considerable amount to Wario's coin total at the end of the game.</desc>

After Malkil's defeat in Ironsword, he went into seclusion for more than 17 years, in which nobody was heard from him during that time. Then, Princess Elaine disappears without a trace, in which Kuros believes that Malkil has captured her and imprisoned her in the dreaded Fortress of Fear, located in the woods of Zanifer. Kuros then ventures into the Fortress of Fear to stop Malkil from furthering his evil plans. However, many people have went inside the Fortress of Fear, but none of them survived.</desc>

The monsters fall in from the top of the screen to build vertical stacks; the player must prevent a stack from growing too high such that it exits the play field. In order to so, the player swaps and moves the stacks about such that falling monsters collide with identical monsters stationed atop the stacks, causing them to be removed from play.</desc>

When a row or column of the same cookies is successfully assembled, the line will disappear, and the player can begin to work on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since this cookie is the key to both games, it should be used wisely.</desc>

    <desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.</desc>

    <name>Yousei Monogatari - Rod Land (Japan)</name>
    <desc>The player(s) control one or two fairies called Tam and Rit armed with a magic wand (rod). Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.

Each level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.

The fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil force that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father "guides" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the evil in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death.</desc>
