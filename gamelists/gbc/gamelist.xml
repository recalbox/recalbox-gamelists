          <desc>It seems that an MI-6 agent has been killed just before delivering a report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department.  As James Bond (yes, the James Bond), you&#39;re going to need your license to kill in order to find out who killed him, and return some stolen money to the King.  Based on the 1999 Bond film of the same title, 007: The World Is Not Enough spans 14 levels, each with several objectives.  Using all of the weapons and gadgetry you can get your hands on, you&#39;ll be challenged to upend a terrorist attack, free hostages from a train station, and much more.  To help you in your endeavors, you&#39;ll have access to a bomb disposal kit, digital camera, covert modem, grapple hook watch, night vision glasses, and about a dozen other items of the like.  The game lets you pick your character, your environment, a range of weapons that will be in play, and a scenario.  This adventure offers three different difficulty levels.</desc>

JOUST casts you in the role of a noble knight from the future mounting you on an ostrich and sending you off into battle. Making full use of the ostrich, you&#39;ll try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot&#39;s seat of an aerodynamic space ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege. You&#39;ll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do battle with a friend.</desc>

          <desc>Army Men is a mission-based combat game that has you guiding a green plastic commando named Sarge in warfare against a tan-colored toy army. Soldiers use bazookas, grenades, flamethrowers, mortars, automatic rifles, and land mines to trash each other. You can also drive jeeps and tanks across the varied terrain. To help you learn the controls, a boot camp option offers a series of eight training missions. &#xA;&#xA;Once you are ready, choose from two campaigns: desert and alpine. Review your objectives before each mission on the briefing screen, and prepare for battle against an onslaught of plastic troops. A mission will fail if you exceed the time limit, allow your rivals to win, or let Sarge die. The options screen lets you view current objectives, consult a strategic map, exit vehicles, and abort your mission. You can also adjust the control scheme, select a difficulty level, and toggle music.</desc>

          <name>Bakusou Senki Metal Walker GB - Koutetsu no Yuujou (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player&#39;s Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player&#39;s Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.&#xA;&#xA;Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game&#39;s bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</desc>

BATMAN BEYOND: Return of the Joker, based on the animated movie, follows the adventures of Batman as he attempts to solve the mystery of the return of his fiercest foe. This side-scrolling one-player game takes the player through 16 levels patterned the animated series, which provides an authentic look. Progression through these levels is far from linear, allowing players to search out hidden rooms, weapons, and enemies. Batman must keep an eye out for more than just his enemies however, because the Joker has set a variety of traps all throughout the game. Use weapons like a club and Magnetic NunChaku, or just take to your foes with your fists and feet of fury! You can also utilize the unique abilities of five different Bat-suits, each granting their own special ability. It&#39;s up to you to finish off the Joker for good in BATMAN BEYOND: Return of the Joker.</desc>

          <desc>Now it&#39;s your turn to sink your opponent&#39;s battleship in this Game Boy Color rendition of the classic strategic board game. Players deploy all four of their ships to different areas on a grid, and take turns firing shots at various parts of their opponent&#39;s grid. Hit each ship the required number of times, and the ship is removed from play. In a unique twist on the classic game, each ship has new weapons. For the solo player, there are 48 missions to complete with animated full-color cutscenes to inspire you to victory! The real challenge however, is taking on a human opponent via a link cable. Forget setting up the board and looking for missing pieces, this is the real way to play Battleship!</desc>

She&#39;ll ask Billy Bob to fetch her rabbits or bass, and it&#39;s up to you to help Billy Bob get them. Obviously, to get the things she wants you&#39;ll have to either go hunting or fishing. Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You&#39;ll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you&#39;ve finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you&#39;ll head out to catch your real prize. BILLY BOB&#39;S HUNTIN&#39; AND FISHIN&#39; is for one player and is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <desc>Lately, the family farm has had a hard time turning a profit. Now, greedy land developers want to buy it so they can build a new theme park. To save the farm, you must take over and try to turn a profit as quickly as possible. You&#39;ll have to till the soil, plant seeds, and harvest the vegetables in an effort to make money. However, you must be aware of which vegetables grow during each season. Once you have earned enough money, you can add livestock to your growing farm, which can bring in even more money. And don&#39;t forget to talk to the townspeople, because building proper relationships with them (as well as buying items from their shops) is important for progressing through the game. Keep the developers away from your farm in HARVEST MOON 2.</desc>

          <desc>A Bug&#39;s Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token&#39;s color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik&#39;s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</desc>

          <desc>Bugs Bunny returns in BUGS BUNNYS CRAZY CASTLE 4 for Game Boy Color! Thinking he has found the Carrot Castle, Bugs has once again entered the Crazy Castle. You must help him escape in this single-player action or puzzle game. This time, more than 60 rooms await Bugs, and he&#39;ll have to use all of his wits and skills to escape with his &#34;hare&#34; intact. Once again, the Crazy Castle is loaded with traps and hazards that will cut your carrot-collecting career short so make sure you don&#39;t get reacquainted with them the hard way. As CRAZY CASTLE fans are probably used to, several Warner Bros. cartoon characters are here to keep Bugs on his toes. You&#39;ll have to fight off Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew, Tweety, and the Tazmanian Devil with one of a variety of weapons, or make tracks to the nearest safe spot. A password save will chart your progress so that you don&#39;t have to start from scratch each time you play.</desc>

          <desc>When humankind discovers an alien race on a distant planet, it becomes clear that the extra-terrestrial way of life threatens survival on Earth. Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth&#39;s best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you&#39;ll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game&#39;s levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there&#39;s plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.</desc>

          <desc>BUST-A-MOVE MILENNIUM EDITION on Game Boy Color brings a bevy of often-requested new features to this classic puzzler. Bubbles of different colors descend from the top of the screen in clumps. Using your blaster that fires colored bubbles of your own, you must attempt to clear the screen as best as you can. BUST-A-MOVE MILENNIUM EDITION offers five unique modes of play. In the returning Puzzle mode, you&#39;ll play through a huge number of new stages of bubble-busting action that require careful planning and fast reflexes. Challenge mode also returns to test your BUST-A-MOVE skills. In the brand new Story mode, you&#39;ll take on a series of increasingly difficult computer opponents in a battle to the finish. Also new is a mode that allows you to play as long as you can last. Of course, the biggest and best addition to BUST-A-MOVE MILENNIUM EDITION is the two-player link cable Versus mode. Now you can grab a friend and show off your BUST-A-MOVE skills! You get all of this plus enhanced graphics and other new options.</desc>

          <desc>Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find CATZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it&#39;s right for you. Once you&#39;ve adopted the little gal or fella, it&#39;s up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

          <desc>Robots are running amok in Dexter&#39;s lab! Based on the popular cartoon series, DEXTER&#39;S LABORATORY: Robot Rampage for the Game Boy Color puts you in the little boots of the Dexter as he tries to reclaim his lab from Mandark&#39;s invading mechanical mayhem. You&#39;ll have to ride elevators, dive down shafts, hide in shadows, and occasionally blast the robotic intruders as you hunt down your evil nemesis. There are three different outfits you can wear to make infiltrating the lab easier: wear your standard lab-coat or one of two special robo-suits, depending on what the situation calls for. You can also use Dexter&#39;s high-tech weapons to dispatch the enemy through level after level of fast and furious action.</desc>

          <desc>Travel back to prehistoric times, with Disney&#39;s DINOSAUR for the Game Boy Color. Loosely based on the computer-animated feature film, players will have to guide Aladar the Iguanadon, Zini the Lemur, and Flia the Pteranodon through 12 different levels, using each of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Aladar&#39;s strength and brute force are great assets, but there are times when the smaller, quicker Zini will need to take over. Neither of them will do you any good if a situation calls for the ability to fly, though so it&#39;s a good thing Flia is with you on this adventure. Learning to use each of these characters to overcome obstacles is the key to avoiding extinction! With video taken directly from the film and an encyclopedia covering all the creatures in the game, Disney&#39;s DINOSAUR will immerse players in a world that existed millions of years ago.</desc>

Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it&#39;s right for you. Once you&#39;ve adopted the little gal or fella, it&#39;s up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.</desc>

It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. &#xA;&#xA;Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. &#xA;&#xA;Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.&#xA;&#xA;Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.</desc>

          <desc>If you have any doubt as to E.T.&#39;s ability to help you get organized, witness the stunning efficiency with which he expressed his desperate need to make a phone call. There&#39;s no need for a separate digital organizer anymore, as you can now keep track of your life on a Game Boy Color. Everyone&#39;s favorite little alien being provides a calendar, an address book, a working clock, and even a &#34;to-do&#34; list that will keep young science fiction fans motivated and productive. There are even five mini-games included, several of which involves helping the titular mascot evade the authorities and collect the necessary items to construct an inter-global telephone system. One of the games challenges you to raise a &#34;Flopgopple&#34; pet, and all of the options are compatible with the Nintendo Game Boy Printer. Kids can even protect all of their personal data with the use of an original password. Now, that&#39;s organization.</desc>

The answer lay as close as the nearest TV, where Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) holds court weekly on The Nashville Network. Sealing the deal for a long time to come, Acclaim has invested some of its many WWF and Turok bucks in the ECW.</desc>

          <desc>What would you do if someone turned you into a llama? Based on the animated film from Disney, THE EMPEROR&#39;S NEW GROOVE casts you in the role of a young Incan ruler named Kuzco. When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma&#39;s dastardly minions will be after you, but you&#39;ll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you&#39;ll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There&#39;ll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that&#39;s rightfully yours. Good luck, llama!</desc>

In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who&#39;s flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don&#39;t think that it&#39;s all fun and games. When the mission&#39;s complete, you&#39;ll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.</desc>

FIFA 2000 is a fully-licensed soccer game that has more than 60 teams from around the world with updated rosters appropriate to the 2000 season. You can choose to play one of five different gameplay modes. Exhibition mode is a quick game where you set the teams and the rules then hit the field. In Tournament mode, you&#39;ll square off against an assortment of other teams to see who can take home the final victory. Playoff mode has you playing the final teeth-to-the-grindstone matches where every victory counts. In League mode, you&#39;ll play through a full season that culminates in the playoffs to see who is the greatest. Finally, Indoor mode takes the game inside and changes up the rules a little bit, resulting in a fast-paced version of the original. Options available for every mode include weather settings, foul settings, wind, and more. You can also use the password to save all of your stats in League and Tournament modes.</desc>

Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef.

Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you&#39;ll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you&#39;re out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

          <desc>PC fans craving real-time strategy action on Game Boy Color may have found their title with FORCE 21. In the year 2015, World War III has broken out. Technology has progressed to the point that air-based nuclear attacks are ineffective, so warfare will be conducted the old-fashioned way: through large-scaled attacks of armored units and infantry. In this one-player strategy or action game, you&#39;ll choose to either control the American or the Chinese military forces, each side comprised of the same eight different unit types. From the speed and power of a tactical helicopter attack to the all-out brawn of a platoon of tanks, you&#39;ll have all the warfare options you&#39;ll need to carry out your plan of attack. In order to complete the game, you&#39;ll have to battle your way through 16 different missions that take place all over the world, in such locations as barren snowfields, yawning deserts, and crowded cityscapes.</desc>

          <desc>Capcom&#39;s arcade-turn-console action platformer Ghosts &#39;N Goblins is a true 2D classic. The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one&#39;s doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It&#39;s still regarded as one of the greats. The GBC version, released in 2000, is a direct port of the NES game.</desc>

          <desc>The world&#39;s best strategy games have two things in common: they start with a deceptively simple board and the goal of taking territory from your opponents. Now HEXCITE brings a whole new shape to strategy games. In HEXCITE, 1 or 2 players battle to dominate the board with pieces of different shapes and sizes. Like any great strategy game, HEXCITE is simple to learn, but challenging to master. And every round is unpredictable until the last play. Who knows? HEXCITE could be the shape of things to come!</desc>

          <desc>First, it was a beloved book, then it was an animated special, next it was a movie, and now Dr. Seuss&#39; HOW THE GRINCH STTOLE CHRISTMAS is a hand-held video game. You play both the Grinch and his faithful pooch, Max, in this creative adaptation. Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you&#39;re a genuine grouch or you&#39;re just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.</desc>

          <desc>First, it was a beloved book, then it was an animated special, next it was a movie, and now Dr. Seuss&#39; HOW THE GRINCH STTOLE CHRISTMAS is a hand-held video game. You play both the Grinch and his faithful pooch, Max, in this creative adaptation. Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you&#39;re a genuine grouch or you&#39;re just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.</desc>

Each bike is rated in acceleration, top speed, and handling so you can pick one that fits your riding style. You can go for a high-speed, low-acceleration model, or if you prefer to burn rubber off of the line, you will want to choose a bike with monster acceleration. When you are ready to ride you will have the opportunity to race on four different tracks including the Arizona Desert, Deep South, Florida Everglades, and California Coast. On all of the tracks you will have to race from sunrise to sunset in order to emerge victorious. Get on your hog and cruise the good ol&#39; U.S. of A in HARLEY DAVIDSON: Race Across America.</desc>

However, you can only tell Kitty to move left or right, and if you are not careful, Kitty will fall off the edge and say hello to the grim reaper. Luckily, blocks fall from the sky, which can be rotated and used to create staircases and bridges to the objects. However, placing three blocks with identical colors next to each other will make them disappear; this can both help and hurt. In addition to the block problems, Badz Maru, Hanamaru, and Pandaba will wander around and cause problems for Hello Kitty. Can you handle the pressure and collect all of the items in HELLO KITTY&#39;S CUBE FRENZY?</desc>

          <desc>Ares is out to destroy Mt. Olympus and the world, and you must take the role of Hercules and save the day. You&#39;ll travel from Olympus to the underwater realm of Poseidon and back again in six different quests. Along the way you will have to fight a variety of monsters and demons. Don&#39;t worry, though, because you are blessed with the strength of a god as well as being equipped with a sword and bow. The game takes place in two different perspectives: overhead for exploration and side-scrolling for climbing and jumping. You also have the opportunity to unlock new levels by linking with the XENA: Warrior Princess game. It&#39;s up to you to save the gods and Earth from destruction in HERCULES: The Legendary Journeys.</desc>

Now HEXCITE brings a whole new shape to strategy games. In HEXCITE, 1 or 2 players battle to dominate the board with pieces of different shapes and sizes. Like any great strategy game, HEXCITE is simple to learn, but challenging to master. And every round is unpredictable until the last play. Who knows?

          <desc>It&#39;s a quiet day on the links. You tee up your ball, and drive it 200 yards down the center of the fairway, leaving a 150-yard approach shot. After taking the approach shot, the ball stops rolling 3-feet from the pin. On the green, you sink the relatively easy putt, and you start your round with a birdie. While most golfers never have days like this, they can with HOLE IN ONE GOLF. Get out on three different courses and try to get the lowest score possible. However, the courses are located in rural areas, so you never know when birds, squirrels, or bears will come onto the course and mess with your shots. Try to play the round of your life with HOLE IN ONE GOLF.</desc>

          <desc>So, you don&#39;t think realistic international soccer is possible on the Game Boy Color? Think again; INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR SOCCER 99 has all of the rules, physics, and intensity of the real thing. You can play as any of 32 worldwide squads, competing for the rights to the International Cup. Choose whether you want to play three, five, or seven-minute halves, and decide whether you want your overtime decisions to be made Golden Goal or Extended Time-style. The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world. Beginners and seasoned veterans alike will get plenty of mileage out of the game, as there are three different difficulty settings to master.</desc>

          <desc>Peacefully sleeping in his Dream Land, Kirby drifts lazily amongst the beauty of the sky. A beauty that King Dedede cannot abide with. Jealous of the sky&#39;s wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night&#39;s stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night&#39;s sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don&#39;t control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.</desc>

          <desc>KLUSTAR takes TETRIS and twists it around. Rather than moving falling pieces, you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver.

          <desc>KLUSTAR takes TETRIS and twists it around. Rather than moving falling pieces, you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen.

          <desc>Peacefully sleeping in his Dream Land, Kirby drifts lazily amongst the beauty of the sky. A beauty that King Dedede cannot abide with. Jealous of the sky&#39;s wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night&#39;s stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night&#39;s sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don&#39;t control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.</desc>

          <desc>Laura discovers a diamond in her basement. After her grandfather tells her that diamonds will attract fairies when surrounded by the energy of good deeds, Laura travels throughout the city to find people in need of help. As with most large towns, there are plenty of people in need of assistance, and each of them sends Laura to complete a task. Fortunately, Laura is never in any real danger--if she makes a mistake, she can always repeat any mission. As another stroke of luck, the citizenry is always willing to help her. When she springs into action to help someone, Laura will enter one of 10 different mini-games that include platform jumping and jump rope. Get Laura to help the people in town, and try to call fairies with her diamond in PLAYMOBIL: Laura.</desc>

          <name>Le Mans 24 Hours (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</name>
          <desc>Take a little trip around the world for grueling, 24-hour race action. Based on the annual racing series that takes place in the south of France, this version will lead you from Toronto to Detroit, to the peaks of Everest. Take your pick from 10 real racing vehicles, like the Nissan R390 and the BMW V12VMR. With more than 10 courses to race on, you&#39;ll certainly have your work cut out for you. Along the tour, you&#39;ll use oil slicks, engine upgrades, invincibility power-ups, and more to get an edge on the competition. The better you do, the more cars you&#39;ll be able to unlock, and thereby improving your chances of taking the cup. There are three different play modes: Le Mans pits you against tough competition in a real Le Mans circuit; Championship takes you through a full season; and Arcade allows you play a single race. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, and there are more options than you could ever ask for. Buckle up and put the pedal to the metal!</desc>

          <desc>To coincide with the release of another Little Mermaid video, Disney has also released another Little Mermaid videogame. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.</desc>

Displeased by their father&#39;s lack of confidence in them, Adrian and Cassius leave Hell and go to Earth to create a new Hell. Since Satan has no time to deal with Adrian and Cassius, he sends his other son Nicky to stop them. You take the role of Nicky as he travels through 24 levels, where he must collect a certain number of items or destroy demons. However, the key to making it through all of the levels is Nicky&#39;s power. When Nicky gets close to fire, his powers increase. He will run faster, jump higher, and spit fireballs. Should he get too hot, Nicky will be unable to control his powers until he cools down. Help Nicky capture Adrian and Cassius in LITTLE NICKY.</desc>

Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they&#39;ll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you&#39;ve got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

In this single-player adventure you play as Sylvester, everyone&#39;s favorite hungry cat, in pursuit of his yellow songbird rival Tweety. TWOUBLE gives you two ways to play: in the first type of stage, you will attempt to catch Tweety in a fast-moving side-scrolling adventure. Duck, jump, and dodge through obstacles in your hunt for lunch. In the other type of level, you will control Sylvester in an isometric viewpoint, and you&#39;ll have to use your wits along with keys and other items to progress through these levels. Watch out for Hector, Granny, and other popular Looney Tunes characters in both types of levels, because they are dedicated to making poor Sylvester go home hungry. Will Sylvester finally catch Tweety Bird, or will he have to enjoy lunch from a garbage can again? With three difficulty levels and a password save system, TWOUBLE has more than enough action for fans of the cartoon duo and their wacky tricks and chases!</desc>

          <desc>MAGICAL DROP has a character facing imminent doom as bubbles slowly make their way towards him from the top of the screen. To get rid of the bubbles, you can grab bubbles of one color from the pile and move them to another area. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they will explode and destroy all of the like-colored bubbles around them. When bubbles are destroyed, those remaining in the pile float up and cause more to bubbles to burst in a chain reaction. This is a rather simple premise, but it&#39;s not easy to master. While the single-player game is fun, use a link cable and share the fun with a friend. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible with MAGICAL DROP.</desc>

          <desc>MAGICAL DROP has a character facing imminent doom as bubbles slowly make their way towards him from the top of the screen. To get rid of the bubbles, you can grab bubbles of one color from the pile and move them to another area. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they will explode and destroy all of the like-colored bubbles around them. When bubbles are destroyed, those remaining in the pile float up and cause more to bubbles to burst in a chain reaction. This is a rather simple premise, but it&#39;s not easy to master. While the single-player game is fun, use a link cable and share the fun with a friend. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible with MAGICAL DROP.</desc>

          <desc>Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy host eight different versions of Tetris in three modes of play: Quest Mode, One-Player Mode, and Two-Player Mode. Quest Mode involves exploring an overhead view of town and then challenging rival characters to a game of Tetris. Defeating an opponent earns players one of the six coins needed to win. &#xA;&#xA;One-Player Mode is a single game of the available Tetris variants, while the Two-Player Mode features three games: UpDown Tetris, Magical Tetris, and the exclusive Harmony Tetris. Harmony Tetris is a cooperative game where each player tries to clear out half the block bin by eliminating lines. If a piece doesn&#39;t fit, players can switch screens and use it to help their teammate.&#xA;&#xA;UpDown Tetris is a race to see who can clear the most lines in the shortest time. Each cleared line is sent to the opponent&#39;s screen and vice versa, until one player can no longer move. Magical Tetris is a head-to-head game in which players send obstacle blocks to their opponent after clearing lines and forming combos. Both UpDown Tetris and Magical Tetris can be played against the computer.&#xA;&#xA;In addition to standard Tetris, players can try Signal Tetris, Tower Tetris, and Target Tetris. Signal Tetris involves changing a horizontal line of blocks to match the ten colors forming the bottom line. Tower Tetris challenges players to repair holes from a partially filled screen of blocks, while Target Tetris is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the screen using a limited number of pieces.&#xA;&#xA;Three difficulty settings are available for both novices and pros alike: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Progress during the Quest Mode and all scores are saved to one of three files via battery backup. As with most two-player games on the handheld, a link cable is required to connect both systems for simultaneous play. Options for two-player games include adjustable rounds and handicap.</desc>

Someone has torn up the map that the twins were going to use to get to the shindig, and now they must pool their resources and find all of the pieces before the party starts without them.

There are tons of mini-games to keep young gamers busy here, including a mini-golf outing, a cheerleading challenge, and many others. One of the game&#39;s best features is a creative music-making program that allows kids to punch in their own cool beats and tunes. You&#39;ll start out the game in the freshman class, but piecing together the map and completing a few of the side games will earn you a pass to the higher grades. Get good marks and chase after good-looking boys in this fabulous adventure.</desc>

          <desc>The sly and evil Don Rafael Montero has devised a scheme to take control of California. The people need a hero, and that is when Zorro appears. You take the role of Zorro, using your sword and cunning to fight your way through 30 levels of action, exploring towns and mines and facing many treacherous enemies. Every wound you receive depletes Zorro&#39;s life bar a little bit, but finding hearts or kissing Elena, Zorro&#39;s beloved and Don Rafael&#39;s daughter, will allow Zorro to regain his health. A soundtrack of Spanish guitar rhythms will make you think that you are in 1820s California. Guide Zorro as he tries to save the people of California from the rule of Don Rafael in THE MASK OF ZORRO.</desc>

          <desc>He might spell his name a little strange, but 10-time BMX Vert Champ Mat Hoffman knows his bikes. Lending his expertise to the creation of this game, Hoffman makes sure that every turn, ramp, and flip is up to snuff. Stunt biking has never been more exciting, as you choose from a list of professional BMX riders and see what magic you can make to out-duel the competition. If you can&#39;t handle the Vert competition, move on over to Dirt or Street tracks, trying to best your rivals for money and fame. The graphics set the game apart from similar fare, while the gameplay has to represent the most realistic stunt biking possible on the Game Boy Color. Hoffman proves that he knows all there is to know about the up-and-coming sport, providing every last detail of a genuine Vert competition without all of the scrapes, bruises, and breaks. Don&#39;t worry, though: if you&#39;re looking to get hurt, there&#39;s always the agony of defeat.</desc>

          <desc>Who do you call when there&#39;s an emergency in Matchbox County? The Matchbox Emergency Patrol, that&#39;s who! Play as a firefighter, police officer, or paramedic in this high-energy challenge based on real-life crises. Whichever hero you choose, you&#39;ll receive word of a situation over your radio, hop in your designated vehicle, and navigate your way to the scene of the potential disaster. Of course, there&#39;s really no way to know exactly what the scene is going to be when you arrive, so you&#39;d better be on your toes. You might find a robbery in progress, but it might just be two people having an argument, so use your best judgment as to how to handle the situation. Modeled after the Matchbox Emergency Patrol series of die-cast toy vehicles, MATCHBOX EMERGENCY PATROL (the game) is an in-depth adventure revolving around crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies. There are nine different missions for each of the three emergency workers, making it a very diverse game.</desc>

          <desc>Mega Man Xtreme 2 is an action-platform game that plays very similar to the first Mega Man Xtreme. Like the Game Boy incarnations of the classic Mega Man series, Mega Man Xtreme 2, reuses elements from first three home console Mega Man X games. The player is tasked with completing a series of side-scrolling levels by avoiding obstacles and destroying end-stage bosses. Stages are typically linear and present a number of traps and enemy robots to combat; collecting DNA Souls and items that refill health, ammunition, and extra lives; power-ups that improve the player&#39;s maximum health; and armor parts that grant X new abilities. Defeating the Maverick boss at the stage&#39;s end will earn the player its special weapon. These weapons can then be used to more easily other bosses, as each one is weak to a unique weapon. After each level, the DNA Souls gathered in the level will accumulate, which the player can use to purchase additional upgrades from Iris. These upgrades range from speed and power improvements, health rechargers, and shielding.</desc>

          <desc>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player&#39;s Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player&#39;s Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.&#xA;&#xA;Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game&#39;s bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</desc>

          <name>Micro Machines 1 and 2 - Twin Turbo (USA, Europe)</name>
          <desc>Tiny cars race through the house in MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo. Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.</desc>

          <desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game&#39;s arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

However, you only have a limited number of shots, and if all sections of the city are destroyed, it&#39;s Game Over. After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city.

Each level requires you to find a hidden key in order to advance to the next stage, a task that becomes increasingly difficult as things progress. Luckily, you&#39;re not going at it alone. You can unlock such friendly beasts as Gali, Hare, Mocchi, Suezo, and Tiger in order to help you fend off all enemies. Each of the friendly monsters serves as a power-up of sorts, increasing your overall speed, granting you temporary invincibility, and more. Fans of the series know just how fun collecting and utilizing monsters can be, and the premise is at its absolute best in this GBA installment. Cool, anime-style graphics abound throughout the massive gaming experience, which allows you to play alone or square off against a fellow Rancher.</desc>

Boasting graphics that eclipse those of most handheld adventures, THE MUMMY RETURNS delivers all of the action and excitement from the film to the palm of your hand. You trek through countless Egyptian locales, battling spirits of the underworld, rats, pygmy mummies, scarabs, and much more. The most important thing is to keep your wits about you you wouldn&#39;t want to become unraveled. Four modes provide hours of original gameplay.</desc>

You can choose from five different cars, each with its own abilities that increase during the course of the race including one car that becomes invincible and another that gains a huge burst of speed. After you choose the correct car for your driving style, hit one of the 20 tracks available in the game. While you&#39;re on the track, you need to keep an eye out for the oil slicks, water puddles, and random debris that will slow down or damage your car. If the car sustains too much damage, then the race is over, for you anyway. Luckily, there is a truck to refuel and repair your vehicle. Will you be able to cross the finish line in NASCAR RACERS?</desc>

          <desc>Are you ready to hoop it up with the pros? Do you have the skills to make it to the next level and take your opponent out like the trash? Are your moves too much to handle? Well, then you might just be ready for the most extreme three-on-three action that videogaming has ever seen. In the bold tradition of arcade classics like NBA JAM, NBA HOOPZ focuses on totally unrealistic, terrifically acrobatic basketball. Fly through the air as you pull off summersault dunks, mind-blowing alley-oops, and graceful outside jumpers. There are no complicated plays or boring rules to hold you back do what you have to do to wrestle the ball away from the other team and put it in the hole. Shaquille O&#39;Neal takes the spotlight in this one, but there are plenty of other NBA stars to play as (though some need to be unlocked by winning games). Choose which players you want to play on your NBA franchise, then jump it up and see who&#39;s the best. Other than the regular gameplay, you can try your hand at 2-Ball, Around the World, Twenty-One, and the Three-Pont Shootout.</desc>

          <desc>NFL BLITZ 2000 brings fast-paced, no-holds-barred football action to the field. Rather than offering a standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL BLITZ 2000.</desc>

          <desc>If you&#39;re a football fanatic looking for arcade-style gridiron action, then NFL BLITZ 2001 from Midway is right up your alley.

Real-life NFL stars are modeled here in a brutish, cartoon-inspired fashion and their burly physiques are perfect for inflicting damage on your opponents. Listen and laugh at humorous commentary from the in-game announcer and garner helpful hints from the sexy cheerleaders as you attack your way upfield towards the goal line. And you can savor all the bone-crushing pigskin mayhem again and again in a helmet-cracking replay mode. You&#39;ll watch in awe as your team catches fire after a series of excellent plays. Compete in four stadiums new to the franchise like the &#34;Stadium of the Future,&#34; watch the action from a range of angles (including Blimp view), go head-to-head in Single-Player competition, and much more. Taunting, tackles, and touchdowns are all part of the &#34;First -and-Goal Frenzy&#34; of NFL BLITZ 2001.</desc>

          <desc>Professional hockey comes to the Game Boy Color with NHL 2000. You can choose from all of the NHL teams, including the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. Play an Exhibition game to work on your tactics and strategies, and when you are ready for long-term competition, try to endure an 82-game Season, or just skip straight to the Playoffs. While in the game, you will have to learn when to make line changes and determine when it&#39;s a good time to pull the goalie. In addition to these tactical decisions, you must also deal with penalties and infractions including offsides, two-line passes, and icing. However, you can customize the game by turning off certain rules and setting the referee&#39;s strictness. In addition, there are three different difficulty levels. Will you be able to claim the Stanley Cup? The only way to find out is by playing NHL 2000.</desc>

During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&#39;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.&#xA;&#xA;Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

At the end of each level there is a bonus course, where you can demonstrate your newspaper-flinging accuracy and earn bonus points. Fortunately, there are three difficulty levels to help you get accustomed to the controls of the game. Will you become the master of your neighborhood or just another punk on a bike?

          <desc>Like the Nintendo 64 game, Perfect Dark for Game Boy Color follows the exploits of secret agent Joanna Dark. In this edition, Agent Dark must complete seven huge missions that involve weapon play as well as puzzle solving. These missions revolve around the destruction of an illegal cyborg manufacturing facilities. The game features full motion video cutscenes that unfold the storyline for the gamer. The game itself doesn&#39;t utilize a first-person perspective for the action -- instead, Perfect Dark GBC features a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, much like what Konami did with Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and what Rebellion did with Mission: Impossible. However, at certain points in the game you&#39;ll be placed in a through-the-eyes perspective as well.</desc>

          <name>Planet of the Apes (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl)</name>
          <desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he&#39;s considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It&#39;s not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that&#39;s really its charm.</desc>

For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokmon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokmon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokmon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch &#39;em all.</desc>

Much as 1999&#39;s Pokmon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokmon Red and Pokmon Blue games, Pokmon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokmon Gold and Pokmon Silver releases.&#xA;&#xA;Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokmon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokmon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokmon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokmon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch &#39;em all.</desc>

          <desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo&#39;s release of Pokmon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999&#39;s Pokmon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokmon Red and Pokmon Blue games, Pokmon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokmon Gold and Pokmon Silver releases.&#xA;&#xA;Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokmon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokmon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokmon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokmon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch &#39;em all.</desc>

          <desc>Your goal in life is to become a Pokemon Card Master. In order to do that, you must pick a deck from three starter packs of cards based on Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur and travel to the eight card clubs and defeat their leaders. Along the way, you will challenge many players to collect new cards and the helpful Professor Mason will aid you by giving you cards as well. While becoming a card master is a laudable accomplishment, the real goal of the game is to collect all of the cards over 200 in all. If you want to collect all of the cards, you must play human opponents in the Pop mode to get a chance to earn rare cards. All of the complexity of the real-world game has been captured here. Play Pokemon Trading Card Game and become a Pokemon Card Master.</desc>

          <desc>There are two tables in the game, red and blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.&#xA;&#xA;Each table has different &#34;locations&#34; that you play, which determine which Pokmon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;Catch Mode,&#34; when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokmon. Once you activate &#34;catch mode,&#34; you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokmon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokmon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;Evolution Mode,&#34; when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokmon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokdex. Once you select a Pokmon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokmon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you&#39;ve collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokmon.</desc>

          <desc>In a rising pit of colored blocks, it&#39;s your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles&#39; positions on the horizontal row. When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear.

It&#39;s up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That&#39;s the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that&#39;ll keep your fingers busy. In the game&#39;s Challenge mode, for example, you&#39;re up against a computer opponent and you&#39;ll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent&#39;s doing the same to you.</desc>

The game is an electronic version of table tennis (or Ping Pong, if you prefer). Players move a paddle up and down, trying to hit the ball past their opponent, and the first player to get 11 points wins. In addition to the classic Pong, there are three other tables to play on. On the Glacier level, two penguins waddle around between the paddles and affect the trajectory of the ball when it hits them. In the Soccer level, players must maneuver two paddles to try to put the ball into the opponent&#39;s net. Finally, the Jungle stage has two rollers in the middle that can change the ball&#39;s trajectory. Get all of the action of the first major videogame with PONG: The Next Level.</desc>

In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne&#39;s world as &#34;hunny&#34;). In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger&#39;s collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you&#39;ll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.</desc>

          <desc>In the addictive, balloon-bursting tradition of POP &#39;N POP and BUST-A-MOVE comes YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast from Taito and Bam Entertainment. Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that&#39;s you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it&#39;s game over. If you&#39;re quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode. YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast is Cartoon Network-licensed, party-popping fun for your Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <desc>The characters from 3DO&#39;s popular ARMY MEN series have invaded the Game Boy Color! This time, you take control of Vikki Grimm as she battles the evil Brigitte Blue. Though you begin as a pint-sized plaything, you can eventually travel to worlds that are of an accommodating size over seven different locations. Each world contains numerous levels, resulting in 43 scenarios overall. Throughout your journey you&#39;ll come across swamps, dungeons, and even intergalactic spaceships. Each level progresses like typical a side-scrolling game, with plenty of action and adventure awaiting you. Some environments offer different weapons and enemies, and you&#39;ll even get the opportunity to commandeer a vehicle on some levels. For those with a penchant for exploration, there are even some hidden worlds to discover that offer even more amazing discoveries and challenges. Progress can be saved using a password system based on which levels have already been conquered. PORTAL RUNNER is a graphically impressive game for a portable system and it promises hours of gameplay, harrowing challenges, and an exciting story to follow.</desc>

          <desc>The gameplay of Power Quest is a mixture of two genres: RPG and fighting game similar to Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi, Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Naguru and Metal &amp; Lace: Battle of the Robo Babes. You venture around the town in which you live on an overworld map where you can go to different locations. Once you arrive at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue. More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging you to a fight. After you are challenged by a character, the game switches to a one-on-one fighting game engine. This is the RPG&#39;s battle system which differs from the usual turn-based battle engine&#39;s of the genre.&#xA;You can buy new parts for your Model which is how you gain experience throughout the game. You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered. Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character.</desc>

          <desc>As time is being torn apart by evil forces, there is only one force powerful enough to stop it: the Power Rangers! In POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE for the Game Boy Color, you take the role of the color-coordinated heroes and fight the good fight. The game plays out in 2D battles and side-scrolling action in two different ways: you will be forced to battle enemies in human form, and you&#39;ll also have to band together and become a Megazord to take down the most powerful bosses. Each character offers several different attributes and statistics, so choosing the right Ranger is critical. There are 15 levels in all, each coming with a different theme. You&#39;ll take the Power Rangers everywhere from pyramids to space environments as you fight to save the world. POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE is a great adventure across time and space, and it&#39;s sure to please fans of both side-scrolling games and the numerous incarnations of the television show.</desc>

          <desc>One of three POWERPUFF GIRLS games released together on the Game Boy Color, THE POWER PUFF GIRLS: Battle Him cats you in the role of the lovable Bubbles. Bubbles&#39; nurturing personality shines in the video game, as you help her collect power-ups and battle the infamous, evil &#34;Him.&#34; She might be an elementary school student, but she&#39;ll prove just how dedicated she is to crime fighting, as you help Bubbles shoot her way through level after level of original action. Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems. Although it&#39;s a one-player game, the trading aspect gives the experience a significantly interactive element.

It seems that a maniacal scientist has transported you to a distant dimension. The only way to return to your rightful place is to solve dozens and dozens of puzzles--each of which will get you one step closer to escaping imprisonment and saving the world. Each unique mindbender uses tiles with varied symbols, charging you with the task of eliminating them, rearranging them, or otherwise manipulating them.

          <desc>Do you love puzzles? Well, you&#39;re about to put your commitment to the test, as you try your hand at more than 150 different brain-bending challenges. It seems that a maniacal scientist has transported you to a distant dimension. The only way to return to your rightful place is to solve dozens and dozens of puzzles--each of which will get you one step closer to escaping imprisonment and saving the world. Each unique mindbender uses tiles with varied symbols, charging you with the task of eliminating them, rearranging them, or otherwise manipulating them. The color graphics and cool sound effects only add to the charm of this great blend of puzzles and plot. Because PUZZLED has so many different challenges, the game takes hours to tackle, and the replay value is high.

          <desc>The arcade hit Q*BERT comes to the Game Boy Color. The player takes control of an orange creature that hops around a course built of blocks. The goal is to change all of the blocks to the appropriate color by hopping on them. As the game progresses, blocks will require multiple jumps. Complicating the process, a snake that wants to destroy you hops around the course, and there are two balls that go down parts of the course undoing all of your work. There are more than 40 levels to complete with several that are larger than one screen. Since all of the action in the game moves in diagonals, there are two different control schemes to maximize your fun. If you remember playing Q*BERT at the arcade, you will enjoy being able to play it in the palm of your hand.</desc>

          <desc>Purebred destruction is the name of the game in RAMPAGE WORLD TOUR. Choose one of three different monsters (each a gargantuan tower of rage), and then join your counterparts as you wreak holy terror on city after city. You&#39;ll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game&#39;s focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there&#39;s little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay. If you&#39;re familiar with the RAMPAGE series, you&#39;ll love the inclusion of three new monsters to take the place of the familiar faces from the original game. The play is faithful to previous titles in the RAMPAGE series, but improved graphics and controls make for the most exhilarating entry to date. Devastation has never been so fun!</desc>

As luck would have it, health power-ups are located in each level, including a special food for each character that boosts their abilities. There are 100 cities to destroy, along with a Two-Player option that allows a friend to join the destructive action. Send the human race back to the Stone Age with RAMPAGE 2: Universal Tour.</desc>

You choose to play as Chris (a cat) or Betty (a little bird), and then take your character through a slew of puzzles, avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. Finding the appropriate items will allow you to jump across furniture, shrink your car, or even climb over your obstacles. Smart strategy and quick reflexes will help you unlock an extremely trying boss level where you&#39;ll take on either a cat or bird in a head-to-head duel. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and that&#39;s certainly the case in this small-scale racing challenge for the Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <desc>The Rugrats are about to find out that the only thing more exciting than traveling through your own backyard is traveling through time. After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you&#39;re the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game&#39;s 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won&#39;t enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie&#39;s attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space! Can you collect all of the lost items and round up the babies before it&#39;s too late?</desc>

          <desc>If you have a little one who is ready to start playing videogames, then you should give RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy a try. There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid&#39;s games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone&#39;s skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed. Now you can help a young gamer get started with RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy.</desc>

Trek through the living room, Grandma&#39;s house, a bedroom, and the garage in your quest for glorious victory. There are 25 missions in all, and the action is spread over 10 huge levels. You choose to play as Chris (a cat) or Betty (a little bird), and then take your character through a slew of puzzles, avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. Finding the appropriate items will allow you to jump across furniture, shrink your car, or even climb over your obstacles. Smart strategy and quick reflexes will help you unlock an extremely trying boss level where you&#39;ll take on either a cat or bird in a head-to-head duel. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and that&#39;s certainly the case in this small-scale racing challenge for the Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <name>RoboCop (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl)</name>
          <desc>Everyone&#39;s favorite metal-plated crime-fighter returns to duty with a pair of handheld game releases for the Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy Color. This one (the GBC version) tells the story of the original film, using television news reports between levels to advance the action and plot points. There are eight different missions rolled up in the awesome package, and each one will require different survival skills and weapons. There are seven forms of firepower to try out, and three vision enhancements that give you different views of the action. The dozens of enemies that will challenge you are each graced with powerful AI, and the streets of Detroit haven&#39;t been this hectic since the Pistons won the NBA Championship. If you&#39;re looking for great graphics, it has those too. Each environment is well-detailed and the character animations rule. Packed with upgrades, power-ups, and hidden stuff, this is one version of ROBOCOP that will never get old--unlike that pesky ROBOCOP 3 movie.</desc>

          <desc>Mega Man Xtreme 2 is an action-platform game that plays very similar to the first Mega Man Xtreme. Like the Game Boy incarnations of the classic Mega Man series, Mega Man Xtreme 2, reuses elements from first three home console Mega Man X games. The player is tasked with completing a series of side-scrolling levels by avoiding obstacles and destroying end-stage bosses. Stages are typically linear and present a number of traps and enemy robots to combat; collecting DNA Souls and items that refill health, ammunition, and extra lives; power-ups that improve the player&#39;s maximum health; and armor parts that grant X new abilities. Defeating the Maverick boss at the stage&#39;s end will earn the player its special weapon. These weapons can then be used to more easily other bosses, as each one is weak to a unique weapon. After each level, the DNA Souls gathered in the level will accumulate, which the player can use to purchase additional upgrades from Iris. These upgrades range from speed and power improvements, health rechargers, and shielding.</desc>

Using a wide array of weaponry that ranges from rifles to bows to muzzleloaders, you&#39;ll search all sorts of scenery in pursuit of your prey. Journeying through the treacherous mountains of Colorado, deep into the expanses of Montana, and through the deserts of New Mexico, you&#39;ll have to keep your eyes peeled if you want to get the jump on these wily critters. There are plenty of animals out there, but each has realistic movements and behavior to evade your efforts. The big game creatures at large include deer, bighorn sheep, elk, and bears. Of course, you&#39;ll have access to the requisite calls, attractants, and cover scents, but don&#39;t expect any of these intelligent beasts to fall right into your traps. You&#39;ll have to use your brains, reflexes, instinct, and some basic perseverance to help bag you a trophy kill.

After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you&#39;re the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game&#39;s 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won&#39;t enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie&#39;s attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space!

          <desc>Jinkies! Join up with the entire gang of meddling kids (Shaggy, Scooby, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) as you try to crack three separate mysteries each based on classic episodes of the beloved cartoon program. Taking the TV episodes &#34;What a Night for a Knight,&#34; &#34;That&#39;s Snow Ghost,&#34; and &#34;A Tiki Scare is No Fair,&#34; the game runs the three stories together with a unifying plotline. You play as Shaggy, trudging through haunted forests, creepy basements, and abandoned buildings with your trusty pal, Scoob. Rather than having a &#34;death&#34; meter, as in most games of its kind, SCOOBY-DOO: Classic Creep Capers has a courage meter Scoob and Shag flee the scene if they get too scared. There are plenty of clues hidden throughout the game&#39;s expansive levels, but if you&#39;re not careful the bad guys might get to you before you can solve the mysteries. While the game certainly offers something for nostalgic fans of the series, it&#39;s a hilarious, original take that will keep gamers challenged as well.</desc>

          <desc>The wackiest computer-animated film of all time has its own classic hand-held game! Boasting fast-paced thrills and the most hilarious characters ever portrayed in a video game, SHREK: Fairy Tales Freakdown turns the story of the movie into a fighting game that players of all ages will love. Taking six familiar faces from the popular film, Fairy Tales Freakdown pits the unlikely combatants in a series of battles against one another each fight taking place in a classic SHREK environment.

The mostly non-violent fighting closely mirrors the humor of the film, resulting in some truly memorable melees. Using animations that are straight from the film, the game delivers the look and feel that made SHREK so successful. Play alone or take on a friend in this lighthearted, tournament-style fighting game.</desc>

There are six spooky levels in all, and each one of them is packed with chills and challenges for gamers of all ages.

Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth&#39;s best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you&#39;ll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game&#39;s levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there&#39;s plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.</desc>

          <desc>Master criminal, Dr. Octopus, is up to his old tricks this time conducting dangerous genetic experiments. Spidey will have to do some serious web slinging if he wants to stop his nemesis! Travel over New York City rooftops, streets, subways, sewers, and all the way out to the docks in your attempt to save mankind. Just like in the popular comic book series, Spider-Man can climb walls, stick to any surface, detect danger with his Spider-Sense, and use regular old hand-to-hand combat to take down his enemies. There&#39;ll be plenty of awesome power-ups to help you catch Octopus: one-ups, hearts, limited invincibility, and more. Lots of characters from the comic book play significant roles in the hand-held game as well: Venom, Lizard, and Hobgoblin will try to take Spidey down, while Carnage waits at the game&#39;s end as a final boss. Fans of the comic series and gamers alike will love this Game Boy adaptation of a time-honored series.</desc>

Boasting superb, full-color graphics and some of the most addicting gameplay you&#39;ll ever experience, SPIDER-MAN 2: The Sinister Six features story elements and animations lifted straight from the pages of Marvel Comics series. Simple controls allow you to get in the game quickly but don&#39;t expect anything else to be so easy. Play alone or take on a friend in this dark original.</desc>

          <desc>SpongeBob SquarePants makes his first appearance on Game Boy Color in the Legend of the Lost Spatula. As the wacky-but-popular character from the TV cartoon you&#39;ll head out on an undersea quest to find the Flying Dutchman&#39;s Golden Spatula in order to become the ocean&#39;s greatest short-order cook. More than 10 stages full of adventure and side-scrolling action make up this epic treasure hunt. Along the way, you&#39;ll meet and interact with many of the show&#39;s popular recurring characters like Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy Cheeks, and Patrick Star. Keep an eye out for hidden clues to the Golden Spatula&#39;s whereabouts as you make your way through each stage, but also be wary of enemies and obstacles. Colorful cutscenes tell the story between levels, and you can use the password system to save your progress through the game. SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS: Legend of the Lost Spatula is only compatible with Game Boy Color systems.</desc>

Should you get caught in a trap, you have infinite lives, and all you lose is time. If you want a friend to join the mayhem, use a link cable and go at it.

          <desc>The game design of the Game Boy Color edition of Star Wars Episode I: Racer is loosely based on the Nintendo 64 version. The game still takes place over multiple planets in the Star Wars universe -- the deserts of Tatooine, the ice tracks of Ando Prime, and swamps of Baroonda. You take control of Anakin and try and defeat your &#34;rival&#34; on each of the game&#39;s tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track&#39;s &#34;rival&#34; alien and his pod racer -- and each alien&#39;s Pod Racer controls and drives differently. The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature -- but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it&#39;s only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds.</desc>

          <desc>One of three POWERPUFF GIRLS games released together on the Game Boy Color, THE POWER PUFF GIRLS: Battle Him cats you in the role of the lovable Bubbles. Bubbles&#39; nurturing personality shines in the video game, as you help her collect power-ups and battle the infamous, evil &#34;Him.&#34; She might be an elementary school student, but she&#39;ll prove just how dedicated she is to crime fighting, as you help Bubbles shoot her way through level after level of original action. Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems. Although it&#39;s a one-player game, the trading aspect gives the experience a significantly interactive element. Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you&#39;ve come to love. Handheld video games just don&#39;t get much more creative (or fun) than this.</desc>

          <desc>The antics of two of your favorite Looney Tunes characters come to life in TWOUBLE for the Game Boy Color. In this single-player adventure you play as Sylvester, everyone&#39;s favorite hungry cat, in pursuit of his yellow songbird rival Tweety. TWOUBLE gives you two ways to play: in the first type of stage, you will attempt to catch Tweety in a fast-moving side-scrolling adventure. Duck, jump, and dodge through obstacles in your hunt for lunch. In the other type of level, you will control Sylvester in an isometric viewpoint, and you&#39;ll have to use your wits along with keys and other items to progress through these levels. Watch out for Hector, Granny, and other popular Looney Tunes characters in both types of levels, because they are dedicated to making poor Sylvester go home hungry. Will Sylvester finally catch Tweety Bird, or will he have to enjoy lunch from a garbage can again? With three difficulty levels and a password save system, TWOUBLE has more than enough action for fans of the cartoon duo and their wacky tricks and chases!</desc>

When you finally locate the perp, you&#39;ll switch to a behind-the-vehicle view as you try to shoot or bump the criminal off the road. Once you&#39;ve managed to lower their life-bar far enough, they&#39;ll pull over and you&#39;ll make the arrest. There are 10 levels of single-player action, so you&#39;ll be plenty busy as you try to collar the criminals. You can also grab a friend to play Head-to-Head using a link cable, with one person playing the cop and the other playing the bad guy.</desc>

          <name>Tetris Adventure - Susume Mickey to Nakama-tachi (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy host eight different versions of Tetris in three modes of play: Quest Mode, One-Player Mode, and Two-Player Mode. Quest Mode involves exploring an overhead view of town and then challenging rival characters to a game of Tetris. Defeating an opponent earns players one of the six coins needed to win. &#xA;&#xA;One-Player Mode is a single game of the available Tetris variants, while the Two-Player Mode features three games: UpDown Tetris, Magical Tetris, and the exclusive Harmony Tetris. Harmony Tetris is a cooperative game where each player tries to clear out half the block bin by eliminating lines. If a piece doesn&#39;t fit, players can switch screens and use it to help their teammate.&#xA;&#xA;UpDown Tetris is a race to see who can clear the most lines in the shortest time. Each cleared line is sent to the opponent&#39;s screen and vice versa, until one player can no longer move. Magical Tetris is a head-to-head game in which players send obstacle blocks to their opponent after clearing lines and forming combos. Both UpDown Tetris and Magical Tetris can be played against the computer.&#xA;&#xA;In addition to standard Tetris, players can try Signal Tetris, Tower Tetris, and Target Tetris. Signal Tetris involves changing a horizontal line of blocks to match the ten colors forming the bottom line. Tower Tetris challenges players to repair holes from a partially filled screen of blocks, while Target Tetris is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the screen using a limited number of pieces.&#xA;&#xA;Three difficulty settings are available for both novices and pros alike: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Progress during the Quest Mode and all scores are saved to one of three files via battery backup. As with most two-player games on the handheld, a link cable is required to connect both systems for simultaneous play. Options for two-player games include adjustable rounds and handicap.</desc>

          <desc>Now you can put Lara Croft in the palm of your hand with TOMB RAIDER for the Game Boy Color. The Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas worked together to trap an evil deity known as Quaxet in a stone that has remained undisturbed for centuries. Now, someone sinister is after the stone, and it is up to world-famous archeologist Lara Croft to find it before it falls into the wrong hands. You must guide Lara through 14 levels of action. Luckily, she can perform 25 different moves to help her get through any situation including running, jumping, crawling, and back flips. Naturally, there are people out to stop her, but they can be dispatched with a few well-placed shots from her pistols. Help Lara save the world from the power of Quaxet in TOMB RAIDER.</desc>

Hopefully, you will be able to beat the competition to the finish line. If your friends want in on the action, you can challenge them to a race with the Versus mode, where you can compete via the link cable.

          <desc>The gameplay in this Game Boy Color adaptation of the long-running skateboarding franchise is much more akin to a balls-out side-scrolling action game than the cautious Kathy obstacle course runs of the first Tony Hawk. Developed by Japanese studio Natsume, gameplay allows several types of grinds that can link combos on the game&#39;s infinite rails, and aerial tricks are nearly as detailed as their 32-bit home boys. GBC owners can choose from 12 professional skaters and skate through seven different locations. No battery save, but the password save system supports the Game Boy Printer for easier logging.</desc>

          <desc>If extreme sports games are your thing, you just can&#39;t beat the intense action and wicked tricks of the TONY HAWK&#39;S PRO SKATER titles. Graced by incredible graphics and video effects, this chapter goes where none of the previous installments dared to go: Canada. Taking the excitement to the farthest reaches of the globe, PRO SKATER 3 also journeys to Rhode Island, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Rio, and Paris, among others. There are literally hundreds of combos and moves to pull off, and the signature control scheme has actually been improved upon this time out. Whereas previous versions of the game didn&#39;t dare leave the skate park, this one forces you to contend with everyday obstacles like pedestrians, traffic, natural disasters, and more. The visual presentation, sound effects, cadre of top-notch professional skaters, and spectrum of tricks has all been improved upon here making for the best TONY HAWK&#39;S PRO SKATER yet.</desc>

Your only goal is to beat the opposition to the finish line, but there are a large number of obstacles in the way including sharp rocks, crabs, and gun-toting hillbillies. Fortunately, there are several power-ups scattered throughout the game to help. For example, soda cans are weapons that can be hurled at obstacles to destroy them, patches allow you to recover from collisions, and beach balls grant invulnerability. Figuring out when to use these items is part of the challenge, as you race down 27 different rivers of varying difficulty. Fans of the arcade classic have something to cheer about, now that TOOBIN&#39; can be in the palm of their hand.</desc>

You&#39;ll pilot an F-14 Tomcat through many levels of training, fighting, and trick flying. The four different terrain types provide a wide variety of unique challenges for would-be aces, and the collection of enemy fighters is mighty, to say the very least. There are 12 missions in all, and each one will require a different skill set and all of the weapons you can get your hands on. Making the most of its access to full-color graphics, this GBC take on the game boasts incredible animations and detailed terrain from takeoff to landing and everywhere in-between. Whether you&#39;re a fan of old action movies or you&#39;re just looking for an exciting game, this one&#39;s a major score.</desc>

          <desc>If you&#39;re ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it&#39;s up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here&#39;s how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There&#39;s no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You&#39;ll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn&#39;t get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you&#39;ll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

In an animated take on AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, you travel to 10 different locales and collect pawprints from 80 cats spread across exotic foreign cities. You&#39;ll need to bop these kitty cats with weapons and power-ups like spatulas, plunger guns, oil slicks, banana peels, and more. Just be careful to avoid chomping plants, squirmy worms, bugs, bees, and butterflies along the way. Lola Bunny updates the action with humorous newscasts between levels as you run, jump, and fly your way to victory. You&#39;ll need quick, button-smashing reflexes and platform-hopping skills of the highest degree to save the kids in TWEETY&#39;S HIGH-FLYING ADVENTURE.</desc>

          <desc>A variety of little animals take center stage in this racing challenge that takes you through some unlikely environments. Trek through the living room, Grandma&#39;s house, a bedroom, and the garage in your quest for glorious victory. There are 25 missions in all, and the action is spread over 10 huge levels. You choose to play as Chris (a cat) or Betty (a little bird), and then take your character through a slew of puzzles, avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. Finding the appropriate items will allow you to jump across furniture, shrink your car, or even climb over your obstacles. Smart strategy and quick reflexes will help you unlock an extremely trying boss level where you&#39;ll take on either a cat or bird in a head-to-head duel. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and that&#39;s certainly the case in this small-scale racing challenge for the Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <desc>It seems that there&#39;s a conspiracy afoot in the WWF! All of the other wrestlers have conspired against you, kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, and stolen the WWF Heavyweight Title belt. Choose to play as the Rock, Triple H, the Undertaker, or Stone Cold Steve Austin in this story-based wrestling game. You&#39;ll roam the streets, taking down thugs and seeking out valuable information along your journey to redemption. There&#39;ll be plenty of objects to pick up and throw, scenery to destroy, and havoc to wreak, but the only weapons you&#39;ll be given are your own bare fists and a solid pair of boots. Other weapons (steel pipes, cakes, and mailboxes) are available, though you&#39;ll have to defeat a few foes to earn them. Tons of power-ups are strewn throughout the game, but you&#39;ll be lucky if you can free up the time and energy to get to them. Awesome graphics, tough boss characters, and a great story make this one unique wrestling title.</desc>

          <name>Wario Land 2 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</name>
          <desc>The game features the return of Wario&#39;s nemesis, Captain Syrup. Early one morning, she and a few of her soldiers, the Pirate Gooms (Spearmen, which are holdovers from Wario Land; several different levels deal with defeating a giant Spearman), sneak into Wario&#39;s Castle and cause havoc. They steal his precious treasure, set off his giant alarm clock, and leave the tap running, flooding much of his castle. After Wario wakes up and figures out what&#39;s going on, he gives chase across the surrounding lands.&#xA;&#xA;The game is noteworthy for several unique features. Unlike most video games of the time, Wario is fully invincible throughout the course of the game, and will not lose lives. The game&#39;s challenge comes mostly through impeding player progress by implementing physical obstacles, puzzle-solving, paths blocked by coin or treasure locks, or forcing Wario back to previously-visited areas. By finding hidden exits in some stages, the player can change the direction of the game&#39;s plot (loose as it is) and uncover different endings, as well as find more treasure. In addition to the Really Final Chapter, five other endings can be unlocked by collecting all the treasures. An enemy-themed Simon Says minigame based on the Game &amp; Watch game Flagman can be unlocked by collecting all the picture tiles.</desc>

The box sucks him inside, where he comes across an odd fellow who claims to have been the ruler of the music box world. He cannot regain control until he finds five small music boxes. Wario agrees to help find the boxes in exchange for all of the treasure he can find and a ticket out of the music box. You take control of the invincible Wario as he travels throughout the kingdom. Even though Wario is invincible, enemies still pose a problem. When a bad guy hits him, Wario will be afflicted with some temporary effect. Utilizing these side effects is key to solving some of the game&#39;s more challenging puzzles. Help Wario find treasure and maybe a music box or two in WARIO LAND 3.</desc>

Luckily, you are armed with a wide variety of weapons, some of the most useful being bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. However, use these weapons wisely, as they affect only certain types of enemies. To keep from being shot down, there are several maneuvers you can use like barrel rolls, dive bombs, and the split S. After eliminating all of the targets in a particular mission, you must return to the Wasp and land if you crash, the mission is a failure. Will you be able to get the Wasp (and yourself) home safely?

Along the way, you will fly 15 sorties in an F6F Hellcat fighter plane to destroy enemy craft that might pose a threat to the Wasp. Luckily, you are armed with a wide variety of weapons, some of the most useful being bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. However, use these weapons wisely, as they affect only certain types of enemies. To keep from being shot down, there are several maneuvers you can use like barrel rolls, dive bombs, and the split S. After eliminating all of the targets in a particular mission, you must return to the Wasp and land if you crash, the mission is a failure. Will you be able to get the Wasp (and yourself) home safely? Play WINGS OF FURY to find out.</desc>

          <desc>So, you don&#39;t think realistic international soccer is possible on the Game Boy Color? Think again; INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR SOCCER 99 has all of the rules, physics, and intensity of the real thing. You can play as any of 32 worldwide squads, competing for the rights to the International Cup. Choose whether you want to play three, five, or seven-minute halves, and decide whether you want your overtime decisions to be made Golden Goal or Extended Time-style. The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world. Beginners and seasoned veterans alike will get plenty of mileage out of the game, as there are three different difficulty settings to master.</desc>

The goal is to reach the final conflict a showdown with an all-too-familiar foe. Loaded with stellar graphics, the game&#39;s animation stays true to the comics that spawned it. The game is designed for one player, although the time limit and distinct level checkpoints lend themselves to comparing progress with fellow players.</desc>

          <desc>In the Game Boy Color version of Xtreme Sports, players compete against more than 200 computer-controlled opponents on 25 different tracks in sports such as street luge, skateboarding, inline skating, surfing and skyboarding. At the start of the game, players choose between characters Guppi and Fin and set off on a trip sponsored by the Xtreme Cola Company, which has invited all extreme sports athletes to Xtreme Sports Island to compete in a tournament. Among the people players encounter are the members of the Bone-Heads gang, who are the antagonists. The player&#39;s objective is to unravel the mystery behind them and win the tournament at the same time.&#xA;&#xA;There are two modes available: Practice and Xtreme Island Adventure. In the former, players can participate in 15 different challenges with 3 difficulty settings. In the latter, players move around the island participating in events and exploring the surroundings. Some of the people players meet will give the player clues to solving the mystery of the Bone-Heads while others will issue challenges to compete in various sports. Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks that will increase the player&#39;s abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.</desc>

          <desc>The classic Atari 2600 game YAR&#39;S REVENGE has made its way to the Game Boy Color. You take control a giant space fly known as a Yar, and you must destroy the Qotile base on the other side of the screen. But you must first get through the large shield that guards the base. Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base. As you progress through the 250 levels, the game moves faster and becomes more challenging. Help Yar destroy the Qotile in YAR&#39;S REVENGE.</desc>

          <desc>In the addictive, balloon-bursting tradition of POP &#39;N POP and BUST-A-MOVE comes YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast from Taito and Bam Entertainment. Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that&#39;s you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it&#39;s game over. If you&#39;re quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode. YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast is Cartoon Network-licensed, party-popping fun for your Game Boy Color.</desc>

          <desc>A talking lemur? The only place you might find such a thing is Zobooland, the magical place from the PBS series ZOBOOMAFOO. Embark on a nine-level quest to collect as many Animal Friend Cards as possible, a task that will require lots of interaction and cooperation with other creatures. Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don&#39;t eat enough, you&#39;ll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won&#39;t be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on. The game is certainly designed for younger players, but three skill settings (easy, easier, easiest) allow the game&#39;s difficulty to expand as kids grow accustomed to the challenges. Though the journey is long, games can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>
